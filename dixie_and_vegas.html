                <h1 id="title">Dixie and Vegas</h1>
                <p>Utah's Dixie is where I restarted my photography hobby. I didn't get as many pictures of Washington and St. George as I might have taken if I had my camera when I first arrived. It's an incredibly distinct area that seems almost as if it were made for landscapes and cityscapes. I was living with my friend Aaron at the time and getting a lot of sun-damage.</p>
                <hr>
                <h2 id="July">&ensp;July</h2>
                <p>I got my <a href="https://www.kenrockwell.com/nikon/d3.htm">Nikon D3</a> that month and a <a href="https://www.kenrockwell.com/nikon/105af.htm">105mm f/2.8 FX AF MICRO-NIKKOR macro lense.</a> The auto focus on this lense is very sluggish compared to newer lenses, it's also very soft wide-open. It is very cheap though, and shoots good portraits. Most of my early work with this lense is way too soft because I was getting to grips with it and it seemed fine from the camera monitor.</p>

                <p>My Basil (Omori (2020)) plushy nestled in the lap of my teddy-bear Misha Masha. Flanked by two Gondolas, one made by my friend Julia on the left, and another bought from KommandoStore and owned by my friend Aaron on the right. Omori (Omori (2020)) can be seen between the Gondola on the right's legs.</p>

                <p>A door-to-door FLDS pie saleswoman sold Aaron and I this pie-shaped cheesecake. We had it with cherries on the back porch. It was creamy and sweet, kinda light, and doused in caramel. It served as a good pair with the cherries.</p>
                
                <h2 id="Oppie Trip">&ensp;Oppie Trip</h2>
                <p>I went to see Oppenheimer with my friends Aaron, Josh, and Bear. It was a cool movie. I got this photo while we made our way back to Josh's Tesla after the film.</p>

                <img src="photos/wheel.png" class="article-image">
                <p>I heard the wheel has TVs inside the cars and sucks. Looks pretty cool from down here though.</p>
                
                <h2 id="Honey Salt">&ensp;Honey Salt Run</h2>
                <p>I made an error in scheduling me and Aaron departing St. George for Vegas to pick up our friend David from McCarran. Wrong week! We went to Honey Salt, an alright restaurant, and met some cool people. A cool goth-looking girl in the parking lot and a fancy couple from Utah IIRC sitting next to us in the restaurant.</p>

                <p>We redeployed to Vegas a little later to get David.</p>

                <img src="photos/burger.png" class="article-image">
                <p>This tasted good but it was impossible to eat! Stupid burger falling apart. Bun was tasty but too structurally sound compared to its contents.</p>

                <img src="photos/scooter.png" class="article-image">
                <p>A herd of sub 50cc engine vehicles passed the three of us on the strip. Cool scooter.</p>

                <h2 id="Last">&ensp;Last Trip to Vegas</h2>
                <p>Aaron and I went to Vegas one last time for a weekend. We both got horrifically high fevers and I could barely walk or stay awake. I had horrifying dreams. A dark sphere I once dreamt I was trapped in as a child lay in my arms, weak and small, its suffocating might whittled away. It beckoned me to do things in a gentle, nudging fashion, softly reminding me of the suprising precision of one particular tool I had used once. I felt so sad for my precious sphere. I love my sphere. I'm glad Vegas built one.</p>

                <p>This might be the sharpest photo I took in the American Southwest...</p>

                <img src="photos/north_strip.png" class="article-image">

                <img src="photos/vegas.png" class="article-image">
                <p>Did you know that some parts of Vegas aren't covered in LED's and neon? At night they don't glow. Spooky!</p>

                <h3 id="Breakfast">&emsp;‚ùè Dogshit Breakfast</h3>
                <img src="photos/bad_breakfast.png" class="article-image">
                <p>Awful breakfast. Was recommended it by a cool older woman with an alternative lifestyle. 5 bucks for old fruit and barely any egg and other stuff. Still was sick too! Should've gone somewhere more hearty. Met a fellow photo hobbyist though!</p>

                <h2 id="Leaving">&ensp;Going Home</h2>
                <p>Bye bye St. George!</p>
