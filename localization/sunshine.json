    "sunshine_h1": "Sunshine Experimental Keyboard",
    "sunshine_p1": "A unique and ergonomic column stagger split keyboard developed to comfortably utilize the entire hand by way of palm and wrist-rest keys. Also, up to four solenoids because I like loud noises (not pictured).",
    "sunshine_p2": "Feel free to use this table of contents to skim the sections you're interested in!",
    "tldr_h2": "Abstract, a fancy term for T.L.D.R.",
    "tldr_p1": "Using the most scuffed, path-of-least-resistance strategies, I developed the best keyboard ever. That's right, the best. Until I make the second version, I mean. Following is an overly-detailed explanation of everything I did and why I did it. Don't worry, there's pictures.",
    "intro_h2": "Background",
    "intro_p1": "I have always been interested in keyboards. When I was six, I meticulously dismantled my mother's non-functioning Smith Corona SD 300 beyond any possible repair or reassembly. Sorry, Mom, I just wanted to know how it worked... As I grew up, I eventually learned about mechanical keyboards from the internet as we all do. Inevitably, I came across the hobby scene for it and bought a few kits to put together.",
    "intro_p2": "The Lily58 became my first ever split keyboard, and I loved it. After learning about circuits to discover how I had botched adding a rotary encoder I eventually moved on to Keeb.io's Iris for double the amount of rotary encoders. Despite my immediate love for ergonomic keyboards, I had a few problems with the ones I was using. While I have big hands, my fingers are proportionally rather short. The uppermost of the four rows on most split boards felt like a big waste of space to me; and my pinkies could not reach the second uppermost row without moving my whole hand for them, let alone the second uppermost row in the outermost columns.",
    "intro_p3": "This meant there were twenty-two unusable keys on the Lily, and twenty on the Iris, but only because it was missing two of those unusable keys in the first place. Additionally, while I loved the knobs on the Iris, I missed having four thumb keys like on the Lily. —Except that fourth thumb key on the Lily was somewhat uncomfortable to reach.— There needed to be a different way to lay them out. Although I saw keyboards like the Ergodox had multiple rows of thumb keys, I didn't like the idea. It seemed inelegant and just as hard to reach. The Kyria seemed to have a better way of handling it. What's more, I needed some sort of wrist-rest to keep my wrists straight due to the height of the keyboards. I had seen some people solve this with weird squishy memory foam things, and others by switching from Cherry MX to Kailh Choc and having no case for the pcb. I had a different idea, however, that would allow me to offset my hands exactly as much as I needed for key switches, without losing the 4mm travel distance afforded by MX switches. As I used keyboards, observed strategies employed by others, and read writeups about design rationales, I would begin to think about what an ideal keyboard might look like for me.",
    "objectives_h2": "Objectives and Considerations",
    "objectives_p1": "As my keyboard experiences deepened and widened and I came to learn what I liked and disliked, I started to adopt a few notions of what I wanted to consider in designing my keyboard.",
    "objectives_h3_theory": "My \"theories\" on design.",
    "objectives_h4_phalanges": "Phalanges aren't the only useful part of the hand.",
    "objectives_p2": "In anatomy, the muscles at the end of the metatarsals form a landmark known as the 'ball' of the foot. There is a similar landmark on the hands at the end of the metacarpals that I will refer to as the ball of the hand because I don't know anything about anatomy and have no idea if there is a proper name for it. If you know what it's called, please tell me. Equally, I will refer to the landmark at the bottom of the palm containing the carpals as the heel. Thankfully this at least seems to be accepted terminology. It is my belief that these two landmarks are underutilized when it comes to keyboards, especially when the position of the heel itself is highly important to achieving a straight wrist to avoid pain. With the appropriate layout, these can be used to grant <i>at least</i> four more keys.",
    "objectives_h4_combos": "Keyboards need to assist easy access to combinations.",
    "objectives_p3": "This means designing to enable myself to avoid combinations involving the pinkies and allow for combos without moving my hands. The best way I can explain this is to break continuity in the story and explain it using the finished product. The shortcut keys on the Sunshine are laid out in a very specific way. That is because sometime you need to press say, <kbd>CTRL</kbd> + <kbd>ALT</kbd> + <kbd>Z</kbd>. On other layouts, you might use your pinky for <kbd>CTRL</kbd> your ring finger for <kbd>Z</kbd> and your thumb for <kbd>ALT</kbd>. On the Sunshine, you just put your thumb between <kbd>CTRL</kbd> and <kbd>ALT</kbd> and push both at once. Your hand doesn't have to move and your pinky can hit <kbd>Z</kbd>. For the very common shortcuts that include <kbd>CTRL</kbd> + <kbd>SHIFT</kbd>, the heel key takes care of that.",
    "objectives_p4": "Thus, I had formed a laundry list of features I wanted, combining pet concepts and accomodations for myself. These were now my objectives for my design:",
    "objectives_li1": "More thumb keys. These are perfect for keys used often on their own or in combination with others like <kbd>SPACE</kbd> <kbd>CTRL</kbd> <kbd>ALT</kbd> or <kbd>GUI</kbd>.",
    "objectives_li2": "Wrist-rest that also serves as an input.",
    "objectives_li3": "Key that takes advantage of the outer \"ball\" of the hand at the fourth and fifth metacarpals.",
    "objectives_li4": "Split, duh.",
    "objectives_li5": "Columnar stagger that accommodates my hands, high stagger on the pinkies in particular.",
    "objectives_li6": "A unique look that stands out from the myriad similar projects.",
    "objectives_li7": "Low spring weight so I can try stenotyping. (This would have interesting pitfalls.)",
    "design_h2": "Creating the perfect keyboard, the easy way",
    "design_p1": "Design began properly some time around March 11, 2022 after I returned to the United States from a long trip to Ireland. Though I had been experimenting with Keyboard Layout Editor throughout my trip and prior, I had finally come up with a design (which borrowed heavily from the aforementioned SplitKB Kyria) I liked. It did away with some of the less accessible looking keys from the Kyria, and increased the stagger on the outermost columns. I added keys for the parts of the hand I thought deserved them, and that was that.",
    "design_p2": "I think this one is the best looking, but least usable. My palms are too long. Note the 1.25U keys in the outermost pinky columns. It's supposed to keep things looking nice",
    "cad_h3": "Cardboard Aided Design",
    "cad_p1": "In order to rapidly prototype my designs I decided to put the layout into cardboard. I used Keeb.io's plate generator to generate a svg I could print as a paper template.",
    "cad_p2": "I would then take the template and tape it down to the cardboard and cut from each of the four corners inwards, supporting around the underside of the cut using a wheel of packing tape. By no means is this good enough for a permanent hand-wire build, but it works enough to test the layout.",
    "cad_p3": "Once twenty two small squares were cut out, I could place the keys down. Here is where I realized the <kbd>BALL</kbd> key could not be such a strange size, and I would have to settle for a 2.75u key. This was for the best, as that let me fit the fourth thumb key.",
    "cad_p4": "But yeah, all that work just to find out it wasn't really that comfortable. I could have just measured my hand... No big loss, though, it was just cardboard and a few minutes.",
    "final_h3": "Finalizing the Design, or why I have hundreds of 13.97mm squares of cardboard.",
    "final_p1": "Long story short, I went through a lot of different iterations on cardboard. Most important to note is that I was attempting to try to move the <kbd>HEEL</kbd> bar around in really small adjustments and then cut out new boards every time. I would print them out, cut them out, and bring them to my mom to test if it was comfy every time. This started to add up in how much time it took. This design pictured here shows the original attempt at a method for pressing <kbd>CTRL</kbd> and <kbd>ALT</kbd> at the same time.",
    "final_p2": "I figured out, thankfully, I could just cut off the bar and move it to where it was comfy and then measure with my calipers where it ended up.",
    "final_p3": "Eventually, I was happy with the design and the positioning of the thumb cluster and the <kbd>HEEL</kbd> bar.",
    "final_p4": "I would go on to export a dxf from keeb.io's plate generator and import it into fusion, then cut it out on my mill. In cardboard.",
    "final_p5": "I attempted to leave an onionskin, since I didn't have a wasteboard underneath and on the first hole I accidentially milled into the bed. Which meant cutting out more squares by hand. I was happy with that, and went on to cut two plates out of polycarbonate, then came designing the pcb.",
    "pcb_h3": "Adventures in PCB design.",
    "pcb_p1": "Prior to the Sunshine, I had designed only one PCB ever before. While I had a strip of a few RP2040s, I wanted the ability to use QMK because I had experience with it and at the time there wasn't support for the 2040. I instead used an Elite-C because I wanted the ATMega32u4, and those are currently either stupidly expensive or out of stock everywhere. After watching a very convincing video by Mitxela on curved traces I resolved to abandon the 45 degree defaults in KiCad. The PCBs, unlike most well-designed split keyboards, are not reversible because I wanted a certain look on the front and rear. Here are some carefully curated photos that make my pcbs look really good and slightly out of focus. In full color, ruining my theme for this page.",
    "pcb_p2": "Really more like under your hands.",
    "pcb_p3": "The place where all the big components go, the Elite-C, the solenoid circuit, TRRS jacks, and reset button.",
    "pcb_p4": "PRO-TIP: This silkscreen decal excuses my design from all shortcomings.",
    "pcb_p5": "Back left side.",
    "pcb_p6": "I really like how the key matrix came out.",
    "pcb_p7": "A friendly face to keep me company while soldering.",
    "pcb_p8": "I won't be posting the PCB files themselves, not until the second version. I'm very proud but simultaneously self-conscious. I hope you like the photos.",
    "keymap_h3": "My Keymap, and other personal adjustments",
    "keymap_p1": "I'll skip the details about assembly, they're boring, it was easy. (Apart from arduously lubing switches and springs...) After it was assembled and sitting on my desk the Sunshine was everything I could have hoped. I set up VIAL and flashed the Elite-Cs with my keymap. My keymap is pretty simple, it's really easier to show it than to talk about it. Colemak-DH and some layers, nothing crazy. Most important notes are that I felt comfortable leaving keycodes intended for normie keyboards like <kbd>=+</kbd> instead of separating them because of how easy it was to add <kbd>SHIFT</kbd> to any combination. The main personal adjustment I want to talk about is spring weight. My alphanumerics are all 25 gram, which is very light. 2U keys need to be heavier but I'm putting off desoldering them and making due. That's why my spacebar is using a 1U key. The <kbd>HEEL</kbd> bars, however are using awesomely heavy 650 gram springs. This makes them exceedingly comfortable as wrist-rests, but simultaneously possible to press down when needed. YMMV, not all wrists weigh the same. If I wasn't using heavy springs I would invert things in firmware so SHIFT would activate when the bars are no longer depressed. Oh and I never use that second alt key. If you have ideas on what I should put instead, hmu pls.",
    "discoveries_h2": "The things I found out along the way",
    "discoveries_p1": "Just as I discovered new likes and dislikes through experiencing and researching previous keyboards, using the Sunshine has lead me to learn new things too. These include:",
    "discoveries_li1": "Going between pointing tools and the right side of the keyboard can make combinations harder.",
    "discoveries_li2": "My pinkies STILL have a hard time reaching the highest row and the outermost columns. (Though not AS hard.)",
    "discoveries_li3": "I miss the convenience of rotary encoders.",
    "discoveries_li4": "Came across this keyboard by total chance. It has a thenar eminence key, could be a really cool input to add to the next Sunshine. Would require a big rework of the overall design but it could be done.",
    "discoveries_li5": "The <kbd>BALL</kbd> key needs to be taller to reach the fourth and fifth metacarpals.",
    "discoveries_p2": "My attempt during cardboard prototyping to rectify the height issue. Impeccable elegance, of course.",
    "plans_h2": "My plans for the next version.",
    "plans_h3_layout": "Adjusted and optimized layout",
    "plans_p1": "I think I will need to adjust the staggers again and go far more drastic. I may also investigate splay. While this might require a whole second round of cardboard prototyping, I have another method I'm eager to try. You'll hear about that next time. While the Kyria-esque layout serves me well, I think I want more stagger.",
    "plans_h3_features": "Feature creep",
    "plans_p2": "I want to add rotary encoders to the next build, at least one. They make pausing and playing media ultra convenient and volume adjust is super welcome too. However, there's more convenience to be had. For one, I love Guilty Gear, and sometimes I actually play Strive instead of listening to the albums while doing other things. I think a small 8-directional switch could be really nice to add if it could fit nicely. I doubt it would replace my fight stick, but it would still be really sweet. That aside, I need a pointing device of some sort, which an 8-directional switch is not suited for. An Oddball-esque arrangement would be really nice.",
    "plans_h3_production": "Production-ready, professional looking design",
    "plans_p3": "I want to be able to release plans for the second version gasket mounted in a case (maybe even sell it 🤫), I think a new version would benefit from the <kbd>HEEL</kbd> bars having a separate PCB, as there is massive wasted area on the PCB as it stands. What's more, I want to use the RP2040 on-board instead of using something like the Elite-C. There are obvious benefits to this, cost being one of them, but I want to do it because it's just more elegant. I also want to find a better way for handling the mosfets and capacitors for the solenoid circuit. They take up a <i>lot</i> of space. Lastly, I want to have cute full-board artwork and better routed traces. I had a lot of cool ideas based on my pothos plant I never implemented and I'd like to give those another go.",
    "bye_h2": "Until next time!",
    "bye_p1": "I hope you enjoyed hearing about the keyboard I made. Sorry if my writing is a bit stiff or awkward. I haven't read a book since last year.

Colemak-DH וכמה שכבות, שום דבר מטורף. ההערות החשובות ביותר הן שהרגשתי בנוח להשאיר קודי מקשים המיועדים למקלדות של נורמזים כמו <kbd>=+</kbd> במקום להפריד אותם בגלל כמה שקל היה להוסיף <kbd>SHIFT</kbd> לכל צירוף. ההתאמה האישית העיקרית שאני רוצה לדבר עליה היא משקל הקפיץ. המקשים האלפאנומריים שלי הם כולם 25 גרם, שזה קל מאוד. מקשי 2U צריכים להיות כבדים יותר אבל אני דוחה את ההלחמה שלהם מחדש ומסתדרת. בגלל זה מקש הרווח שלי משתמש במקש 1U. פסי ה-<kbd>HEEL</kbd>, לעומת זאת, משתמשים בקפיצים כבדים להפליא של 650 גרם. זה הופך אותם לנוחים ביותר כמשענות לשורש כף היד, אך בו זמנית מאפשר ללחוץ עליהם בעת הצורך. התוצאות עשויות להשתנות, לא כל שורשי כף היד שוקלים אותו דבר. אם לא הייתי משתמשת בקפיצים כבדים הייתי הופכת דברים בקושחה כך ש-SHIFT יופעל כאשר הפסים כבר לא לחוצים. אה ואני אף פעם לא משתמשת במקש ה-alt השני הזה. אם יש לכם רעיונות מה לשים במקום, תכתבו לי בבקשה.",

Далее следует чрезмерно подробное объяснение всего, что я сделала и почему. Не волнуйтесь, картинки будут.",
    "intro_h2": "Предыстория",
    "intro_p1": "Меня всегда интересовали клавиатуры. Когда мне было шесть, я дотошно разобрала неработающую печатную машинку моей мамы Smith Corona SD 300 до состояния, не подлежащего ремонту или сборке. Прости, мам, я просто хотела знать, как она работает... Повзрослев, я, как и все мы, узнала о механических клавиатурах из интернета. Неизбежно я наткнулась на хобби-сообщество и купила несколько наборов для сборки.",
    "intro_p2": "Lily58 стала моей первой раздельной клавиатурой, и я ее обожала. Изучив электронику, чтобы понять, как я умудрилась испортить добавление энкодера, я в конечном итоге перешла на Iris от Keeb.io ради удвоенного количества энкодеров. Несмотря на мою немедленную любовь к эргономичным клавиатурам, у меня было несколько проблем с теми, что я использовала. Хотя у меня большие руки, пальцы у меня пропорционально довольно короткие. Самый верхний из четырех рядов на большинстве раздельных клавиатур казался мне большой тратой места; а мизинцы не могли дотянуться до второго сверху ряда, не двигая всей рукой, не говоря уже о втором сверху ряду в самых дальних столбцах.",
    "intro_p3": "Это означало, что на Lily было двадцать две бесполезные клавиши, а на Iris — двадцать, но только потому, что на ней изначально отсутствовали две из этих бесполезных клавиш. Кроме того, хотя мне нравились крутилки на Iris, мне не хватало четырех клавиш под большой палец, как на Lily. — За исключением того, что до четвертой клавиши под большой палец на Lily было несколько неудобно дотягиваться. — Нужно было придумать другой способ их расположения. Хотя я видела клавиатуры вроде Ergodox с несколькими рядами клавиш под большой палец, мне эта идея не нравилась. Она казалась неэлегантной и такой же труднодоступной. У Kyria, казалось, был лучший способ решения этой проблемы. Более того, мне нужна была какая-то подставка под запястья, чтобы держать их прямо из-за высоты клавиатур. Я видела, как некоторые решали эту проблему с помощью странных мягких штук из пены с эффектом памяти, а другие — переходя с Cherry MX на Kailh Choc и не используя корпус для печатной платы. Однако у меня была другая идея, которая позволила бы мне поднимать руки ровно настолько, насколько мне нужно для клавишных переключателей, не теряя при этом 4-миллиметровый ход, обеспечиваемый переключателями MX. По мере того как я пользовалась клавиатурами, наблюдала за стратегиями других и читала описания дизайнерских решений, я начала задумываться о том, как могла бы выглядеть идеальная для меня клавиатура.",
    "objectives_h2": "Цели и соображения",
    "objectives_p1": "По мере того как мой опыт с клавиатурами углублялся и расширялся, и я узнавала, что мне нравится, а что нет, я начала формировать несколько представлений о том, что я хочу учесть при проектировании своей клавиатуры.",

    "objectives_p2": "В анатомии мышцы на конце плюсневых костей образуют ориентир, известный как «подушечка» стопы. На руках есть похожий ориентир на конце пястных костей, который я буду называть подушечкой кисти, потому что я ничего не знаю об анатомии и понятия не имею, есть ли у него правильное название. Если вы знаете, как это называется, пожалуйста, скажите мне. Точно так же я буду называть ориентир в нижней части ладони, содержащий кости запястья, пяткой. К счастью, это, по крайней мере, кажется общепринятой терминологией. Я считаю, что эти два ориентира недостаточно используются в клавиатурах, особенно когда положение самой пятки очень важно для достижения прямого запястья во избежание боли. При правильной раскладке их можно использовать, чтобы получить <i>как минимум</i> еще четыре клавиши.",
    "objectives_h4_combos": "Клавиатуры должны облегчать доступ к комбинациям.",
    "objectives_p3": "Это означает проектирование, которое позволит мне избегать комбинаций с участием мизинцев и использовать комбинации, не двигая руками. Лучший способ объяснить это — нарушить последовательность повествования и объяснить на примере готового продукта. Клавиши быстрого доступа на Sunshine расположены очень специфическим образом. Это потому, что иногда нужно нажать, скажем, <kbd>CTRL</kbd> + <kbd>ALT</kbd> + <kbd>Z</kbd>. На других раскладках вы могли бы использовать мизинец для <kbd>CTRL</kbd>, безымянный палец для <kbd>Z</kbd> и большой палец для <kbd>ALT</kbd>. На Sunshine вы просто помещаете большой палец между <kbd>CTRL</kbd> и <kbd>ALT</kbd> и нажимаете обе клавиши одновременно. Ваша рука не двигается, а мизинец может нажать <kbd>Z</kbd>. Для очень распространенных сочетаний, включающих <kbd>CTRL</kbd> + <kbd>SHIFT</kbd>, для этого и нужна клавиша под пятку.",
    "objectives_p4": "Таким образом, у меня сформировался целый список желаемых функций, сочетающий в себе любимые концепции и приспособления для себя. Теперь это были мои цели для моего дизайна:",
    "objectives_li1": "Больше клавиш под большой палец. Они идеально подходят для часто используемых клавиш как самих по себе, так и в сочетании с другими, такими как <kbd>SPACE</kbd>, <kbd>CTRL</kbd>, <kbd>ALT</kbd> или <kbd>GUI</kbd>.",

Хотя я экспериментировала с Keyboard Layout Editor на протяжении всей поездки и до нее, я наконец-то придумала дизайн, который мне понравился (и который сильно заимствовал у вышеупомянутой SplitKB Kyria). Он избавлялся от некоторых менее доступных на вид клавиш из Kyria и увеличивал смещение на самых дальних столбцах. Я добавила клавиши для тех частей руки, которые, по моему мнению, их заслуживали, и на этом все.",
    "design_p2": "Я думаю, что этот вариант выглядит лучше всего, но он наименее удобен. Мои ладони слишком длинные. Обратите внимание на клавиши 1.25U в самых дальних столбцах мизинцев. Это должно было сделать вид приятнее.",
    "cad_h3": "Проектирование с помощью картона",
    "cad_p1": "Чтобы быстро создавать прототипы моих дизайнов, я решила воплотить раскладку в картоне. Я использовала генератор пластин Keeb.io, чтобы создать SVG, который я могла распечатать в качестве бумажного шаблона.",
    "cad_p2": "Затем я брала шаблон, приклеивала его к картону и вырезала от каждого из четырех углов внутрь, поддерживая вырез снизу с помощью рулона упаковочной ленты. Этого ни в коем случае не достаточно для постоянной ручной сборки, но для тестирования раскладки вполне подходит.",
    "cad_p3": "Как только двадцать два маленьких квадратика были вырезаны, я могла разместить клавиши. Именно здесь я поняла, что клавиша <kbd>BALL</kbd> не может быть такого странного размера, и мне придется остановиться на клавише 2.75u. Это было к лучшему, потому что это позволило мне разместить четвертую клавишу под большой палец.",
    "cad_p4": "Но да, вся эта работа только для того, чтобы выяснить, что это было не так уж и удобно. Я могла бы просто измерить свою руку... Но ничего страшного, это был всего лишь картон и несколько минут.",
    "final_h3": "Завершение дизайна, или почему у меня сотни картонных квадратов размером 13,97 мм.",
    "final_p1": "Короче говоря, я перепробовала много разных итераций на картоне. Самое важное, что я пыталась перемещать планку <kbd>HEEL</kbd> с очень маленькими шагами, а затем каждый раз вырезала новые платы. Я распечатывала их, вырезала и каждый раз приносила маме, чтобы проверить, удобно ли. Это начало отнимать много времени. На этом изображении показана первоначальная попытка реализовать метод одновременного нажатия <kbd>CTRL</kbd> и <kbd>ALT</kbd>.",
    "final_p2": "К счастью, я догадалась, что могу просто отрезать планку, переместить ее в удобное место, а затем измерить штангенциркулем, где она оказалась.",

    "final_p5": "Я попыталась оставить тонкий слой, так как у меня не было подложки, и на первом же отверстии я случайно профрезеровала станину. Это означало вырезать больше квадратов вручную.

    "pcb_p1": "До Sunshine я спроектировала всего одну печатную плату. Хотя у меня была полоска из нескольких RP2040, я хотела иметь возможность использовать QMK, потому что у меня был опыт работы с ним, а в то время поддержки 2040 не было. Вместо этого я использовала Elite-C, потому что мне нужен был ATMega32u4, а они сейчас либо безумно дорогие, либо их нигде нет в наличии. Посмотрев очень убедительное видео от Mitxela о криволинейных дорожках, я решила отказаться от стандартных 45-градусных углов в KiCad. Печатные платы, в отличие от большинства хорошо спроектированных раздельных клавиатур, не являются двусторонними, потому что я хотела определенного вида спереди и сзади. Вот несколько тщательно отобранных фотографий, на которых мои печатные платы выглядят действительно хорошо и немного не в фокусе. В полном цвете, что разрушает мою тему для этой страницы.",

    "keymap_h3": "Моя раскладка и другие личные настройки",
    "keymap_p1": "Я пропущу детали сборки, они скучные, все было легко. (Кроме утомительной смазки переключателей и пружин...) После сборки и установки на мой стол Sunshine была всем, на что я могла надеяться. Я настроила VIAL и прошила Elite-C своей раскладкой. Моя раскладка довольно проста, ее действительно легче показать, чем рассказать о ней. Colemak-DH и несколько слоев, ничего сумасшедшего. Самое важное, что я чувствовала себя комфортно, оставляя коды клавиш, предназначенные для клавиатур для нормисов, вроде <kbd>=+</kbd>, вместо того, чтобы разделять их, из-за того, как легко было добавить <kbd>SHIFT</kbd> к любой комбинации. Основная личная настройка, о которой я хочу поговорить, — это жесткость пружин. Мои буквенно-цифровые клавиши имеют жесткость 25 грамм, что очень легко. Клавиши 2U должны быть тяжелее, но я откладываю их перепайку и обхожусь тем, что есть. Вот почему мой пробел использует клавишу 1U. Однако планки <kbd>HEEL</kbd> используют потрясающе тяжелые пружины в 650 грамм. Это делает их чрезвычайно удобными в качестве подставок под запястья, но в то же время позволяет нажимать на них при необходимости. Ваши результаты могут отличаться, не все запястья весят одинаково. Если бы я не использовала тяжелые пружины, я бы инвертировала это в прошивке, чтобы SHIFT активировался, когда планки больше не нажаты. О, и я никогда не использую эту вторую клавишу alt. Если у вас есть идеи, что мне стоит поставить вместо нее, дайте знать, пожалуйста.",

Хотя это может потребовать целого второго раунда прототипирования из картона, у меня есть другой метод, который мне не терпится попробовать. Вы услышите о нем в следующий раз. Хотя раскладка в стиле Kyria мне вполне подходит, я думаю, что хочу большего смещения.",
    "plans_h3_features": "Разрастание функционала",
    "plans_p2": "Я хочу добавить энкодеры в следующую сборку, по крайней мере, один. Они делают паузу и воспроизведение мультимедиа чрезвычайно удобными, а регулировка громкости тоже очень приветствуется. Однако можно добиться еще большего удобства. Во-первых, я люблю Guilty Gear, и иногда я действительно играю в Strive, а не слушаю альбомы, занимаясь другими делами. Я думаю, что небольшой 8-позиционный переключатель было бы очень приятно добавить, если бы он хорошо вписался. Сомневаюсь, что он заменит мой файтстик, но все равно было бы очень круто. Кроме того, мне нужно какое-то указывающее устройство, для которого 8-позиционный переключатель не подходит. Расположение в стиле Oddball было бы очень кстати.",
    "plans_h3_production": "Готовый к производству, профессионально выглядящий дизайн",
    "plans_p3": "Я хочу иметь возможность выпустить чертежи для второй версии с гаскет-маунтом в корпусе (может быть, даже продавать ее 🤫), я думаю, что новая версия выиграет от того, что планки <kbd>HEEL</kbd> будут иметь отдельную печатную плату, так как на текущей плате много потраченного впустую места. Более того, я хочу использовать RP2040 на плате вместо чего-то вроде Elite-C. У этого есть очевидные преимущества, стоимость — одно из них, но я хочу сделать это, потому что это просто более элегантно. Я также хочу найти лучший способ для размещения мосфетов и конденсаторов для схемы соленоида. Они занимают <i>очень</i> много места. Наконец, я хочу иметь милый арт на всю плату и лучше разведенные дорожки. У меня было много крутых идей, основанных на моем растении потос, которые я так и не реализовала, и я бы хотела дать им еще один шанс.",

    "tldr_p1": "Mit den hemdsärmeligsten Strategien und dem Weg des geringsten Widerstands habe ich die beste Tastatur aller Zeiten entwickelt. Ja, genau, die beste. Bis ich die zweite Version mache, meine ich. Es folgt eine übermäßig detaillierte Erklärung von allem, was ich getan habe und warum ich es getan habe. Keine Sorge, es gibt Bilder.",
    "intro_h2": "Hintergrund",
    "intro_p1": "Ich habe mich schon immer für Tastaturen interessiert. Als ich sechs war, habe ich die nicht funktionierende Smith Corona SD 300 meiner Mutter akribisch zerlegt, bis eine Reparatur oder ein Zusammenbau unmöglich war. Entschuldigung, Mama, ich wollte nur wissen, wie sie funktioniert... Als ich älter wurde, lernte ich schließlich, wie wir alle, über mechanische Tastaturen aus dem Internet. Unweigerlich stieß ich auf die Hobbyszene und kaufte ein paar Bausätze zum Zusammenbauen.",
    "intro_p2": "Die Lily58 wurde meine allererste geteilte Tastatur, und ich liebte sie. Nachdem ich etwas über Schaltkreise gelernt hatte, um herauszufinden, wie ich das Hinzufügen eines Drehgebers verpfuscht hatte, wechselte ich schließlich zu Keeb.ios Iris für die doppelte Anzahl von Drehgebern. Trotz meiner sofortigen Liebe zu ergonomischen Tastaturen hatte ich ein paar Probleme mit denen, die ich benutzte. Obwohl ich große Hände habe, sind meine Finger proportional eher kurz. Die oberste der vier Reihen auf den meisten geteilten Tastaturen fühlte sich für mich wie eine große Platzverschwendung an; und meine kleinen Finger konnten die zweitoberste Reihe nicht erreichen, ohne meine ganze Hand zu bewegen, geschweige denn die zweitoberste Reihe in den äußersten Spalten.",
    "intro_p3": "Das bedeutete, dass es auf der Lily zweiundzwanzig unbrauchbare Tasten gab und zwanzig auf der Iris, aber nur, weil ihr von vornherein zwei dieser unbrauchbaren Tasten fehlten. Außerdem vermisste ich, obwohl ich die Drehknöpfe auf der Iris liebte, vier Daumentasten wie auf der Lily. —Außer, dass die vierte Daumentaste auf der Lily etwas unbequem zu erreichen war.— Es musste eine andere Art der Anordnung geben. Obwohl ich Tastaturen wie die Ergodox mit mehreren Reihen von Daumentasten sah, gefiel mir die Idee nicht. Es schien unelegant und genauso schwer zu erreichen. Die Kyria schien einen besseren Weg zu haben. Außerdem brauchte ich eine Art Handgelenkstütze, um meine Handgelenke aufgrund der Höhe der Tastaturen gerade zu halten. Ich hatte gesehen, wie einige Leute dies mit seltsamen, matschigen Memory-Foam-Dingern lösten und andere, indem sie von Cherry MX zu Kailh Choc wechselten und kein Gehäuse für die Leiterplatte hatten. Ich hatte jedoch eine andere Idee, die es mir ermöglichen würde, meine Hände genau so weit anzuheben, wie ich es für die Tastenschalter brauchte, ohne den 4 mm Hubweg der MX-Schalter zu verlieren. Als ich Tastaturen benutzte, Strategien anderer beobachtete und Berichte über Design-Begründungen las, begann ich darüber nachzudenken, wie eine ideale Tastatur für mich aussehen könnte.",
    "objectives_h2": "Ziele und Überlegungen",
    "objectives_p1": "Als meine Tastaturerfahrungen sich vertieften und erweiterten und ich lernte, was mir gefiel und was nicht, begann ich, einige Vorstellungen davon zu entwickeln, was ich bei der Gestaltung meiner Tastatur berücksichtigen wollte.",
    "objectives_h3_theory": "Meine „Theorien“ zum Design.",
    "objectives_h4_phalanges": "Die Fingerglieder sind nicht der einzige nützliche Teil der Hand.",
    "objectives_p2": "In der Anatomie bilden die Muskeln am Ende der Mittelfußknochen einen Orientierungspunkt, der als „Fußballen“ bekannt ist. Es gibt einen ähnlichen Orientierungspunkt an den Händen am Ende der Mittelhandknochen, den ich als Handballen bezeichnen werde, weil ich nichts über Anatomie weiß und keine Ahnung habe, ob es einen richtigen Namen dafür gibt. Wenn ihr wisst, wie es heißt, sagt es mir bitte. Ebenso werde ich den Orientierungspunkt am unteren Ende der Handfläche, der die Handwurzelknochen enthält, als Ferse bezeichnen. Glücklicherweise scheint dies zumindest eine akzeptierte Terminologie zu sein. Ich bin der Überzeugung, dass diese beiden Orientierungspunkte bei Tastaturen zu wenig genutzt werden, insbesondere wenn die Position der Ferse selbst sehr wichtig ist, um ein gerades Handgelenk zu erreichen und Schmerzen zu vermeiden. Mit dem entsprechenden Layout können diese verwendet werden, um <i>mindestens</i> vier weitere Tasten zu erhalten.",
    "objectives_h4_combos": "Tastaturen müssen den einfachen Zugriff auf Kombinationen unterstützen.",
    "objectives_p3": "Das bedeutet, so zu gestalten, dass ich Kombinationen mit den kleinen Fingern vermeiden und Kombinationen ohne Bewegung der Hände ermöglichen kann. Der beste Weg, dies zu erklären, ist, die Kontinuität der Geschichte zu unterbrechen und es am fertigen Produkt zu erklären. Die Tastenkombinationen auf der Sunshine sind auf eine ganz bestimmte Weise angeordnet. Das liegt daran, dass man manchmal, sagen wir, <kbd>STRG</kbd> + <kbd>ALT</kbd> + <kbd>Z</kbd> drücken muss. Bei anderen Layouts würdet ihr vielleicht euren kleinen Finger für <kbd>STRG</kbd>, euren Ringfinger für <kbd>Z</kbd> und euren Daumen für <kbd>ALT</kbd> verwenden. Auf der Sunshine legt ihr einfach euren Daumen zwischen <kbd>STRG</kbd> und <kbd>ALT</kbd> und drückt beide gleichzeitig. Eure Hand muss sich nicht bewegen und euer kleiner Finger kann <kbd>Z</kbd> treffen. Für die sehr häufigen Tastenkombinationen mit <kbd>STRG</kbd> + <kbd>SHIFT</kbd> sorgt die Fersentaste.",
    "objectives_p4": "So hatte ich eine lange Liste von Funktionen gebildet, die ich wollte, eine Kombination aus Lieblingskonzepten und Anpassungen für mich selbst. Dies waren nun meine Ziele für mein Design:",
    "objectives_li1": "Mehr Daumentasten. Diese sind perfekt für Tasten, die oft allein oder in Kombination mit anderen wie <kbd>SPACE</kbd>, <kbd>CTRL</kbd>, <kbd>ALT</kbd> oder <kbd>GUI</kbd> verwendet werden.",
    "objectives_li2": "Handgelenkstütze, die auch als Eingabe dient.",
    "objectives_li3": "Eine Taste, die den äußeren „Ballen“ der Hand am vierten und fünften Mittelhandknochen nutzt.",
    "objectives_li4": "Geteilt, natürlich.",
    "objectives_li5": "Spaltenweiser Versatz, der meinen Händen entgegenkommt, insbesondere ein hoher Versatz bei den kleinen Fingern.",
    "objectives_li6": "Ein einzigartiges Aussehen, das sich von den unzähligen ähnlichen Projekten abhebt.",
    "objectives_li7": "Geringes Federgewicht, damit ich Stenografie ausprobieren kann. (Dies würde interessante Tücken mit sich bringen.)",
    "design_h2": "Die perfekte Tastatur erschaffen, auf die einfache Art",
    "design_p1": "Das Design begann richtig um den 11. März 2022, nachdem ich aus einer langen Reise nach Irland in die Vereinigten Staaten zurückgekehrt war. Obwohl ich während meiner Reise und davor mit dem Keyboard Layout Editor experimentiert hatte, hatte ich endlich ein Design gefunden (das stark von der oben erwähnten SplitKB Kyria inspiriert war), das mir gefiel. Es verzichtete auf einige der weniger zugänglich aussehenden Tasten der Kyria und erhöhte den Versatz an den äußersten Spalten. Ich fügte Tasten für die Teile der Hand hinzu, die sie meiner Meinung nach verdienten, und das war's.",
    "design_p2": "Ich denke, diese sieht am besten aus, ist aber am wenigsten brauchbar. Meine Handflächen sind zu lang. Beachtet die 1,25-U-Tasten in den äußersten Spalten der kleinen Finger. Es soll alles schön aussehen lassen.",
    "cad_h3": "Cardboard Aided Design",
    "cad_p1": "Um meine Entwürfe schnell zu prototypisieren, beschloss ich, das Layout in Pappe umzusetzen. Ich benutzte den Plattengenerator von Keeb.io, um ein SVG zu generieren, das ich als Papiervorlage drucken konnte.",
    "cad_p2": "Ich nahm dann die Vorlage, klebte sie auf die Pappe und schnitt von jeder der vier Ecken nach innen, wobei ich die Unterseite des Schnitts mit einer Rolle Packband stützte. Dies ist keineswegs gut genug für einen dauerhaften handverdrahteten Aufbau, aber es funktioniert ausreichend, um das Layout zu testen.",
    "cad_p3": "Sobald zweiundzwanzig kleine Quadrate ausgeschnitten waren, konnte ich die Tasten platzieren. Hier wurde mir klar, dass die <kbd>BALL</kbd>-Taste keine so seltsame Größe haben konnte und ich mich mit einer 2,75u-Taste zufrieden geben musste. Das war das Beste, denn so passte die vierte Daumentaste.",
    "cad_p4": "Aber ja, all die Arbeit nur, um herauszufinden, dass es nicht wirklich so bequem war. Ich hätte einfach meine Hand messen können... Kein großer Verlust, es war ja nur Pappe und ein paar Minuten.",
    "final_h3": "Das Design fertigstellen, oder warum ich Hunderte von 13,97-mm-Quadraten aus Pappe habe.",
    "final_p1": "Lange Rede, kurzer Sinn, ich habe viele verschiedene Iterationen auf Pappe durchgemacht. Am wichtigsten ist, dass ich versuchte, die <kbd>HEEL</kbd>-Leiste in wirklich kleinen Anpassungen zu verschieben und dann jedes Mal neue Platinen auszuschneiden. Ich druckte sie aus, schnitt sie aus und brachte sie jedes Mal zu meiner Mutter, um zu testen, ob es bequem war. Das summierte sich zeitlich. Dieses hier abgebildete Design zeigt den ursprünglichen Versuch einer Methode zum gleichzeitigen Drücken von <kbd>STRG</kbd> und <kbd>ALT</kbd>.",
    "final_p2": "Zum Glück fand ich heraus, dass ich die Leiste einfach abschneiden und dorthin verschieben konnte, wo es bequem war, und dann mit meinem Messschieber messen konnte, wo sie landete.",
    "final_p3": "Schließlich war ich mit dem Design und der Positionierung des Daumenclusters und der <kbd>HEEL</kbd>-Leiste zufrieden.",
    "final_p4": "Ich exportierte dann eine DXF-Datei aus dem Plattengenerator von keeb.io und importierte sie in Fusion, um sie dann auf meiner Fräse auszuschneiden. Aus Pappe.",
    "final_p5": "Ich versuchte, eine Zwiebelschale zu lassen, da ich keine Opferplatte darunter hatte und beim ersten Loch versehentlich ins Bett gefräst habe. Was bedeutete, mehr Quadrate von Hand auszuschneiden. Ich war damit zufrieden und schnitt dann zwei Platten aus Polycarbonat aus, dann kam das Design der Leiterplatte.",
    "pcb_h3": "Abenteuer im Leiterplattendesign.",
    "pcb_p1": "Vor der Sunshine hatte ich nur eine einzige Leiterplatte entworfen. Obwohl ich einen Streifen mit ein paar RP2040s hatte, wollte ich die Möglichkeit haben, QMK zu verwenden, weil ich damit Erfahrung hatte und es zu der Zeit keine Unterstützung für den 2040 gab. Stattdessen verwendete ich einen Elite-C, weil ich den ATMega32u4 wollte, und die sind derzeit entweder wahnsinnig teuer oder überall ausverkauft. Nachdem ich ein sehr überzeugendes Video von Mitxela über gekrümmte Leiterbahnen gesehen hatte, beschloss ich, die 45-Grad-Standardeinstellungen in KiCad aufzugeben. Die Leiterplatten sind, im Gegensatz zu den meisten gut durchdachten geteilten Tastaturen, nicht reversibel, weil ich ein bestimmtes Aussehen auf der Vorder- und Rückseite wollte. Hier sind einige sorgfältig ausgewählte Fotos, die meine Leiterplatten wirklich gut und leicht unscharf aussehen lassen. In voller Farbe, was mein Thema für diese Seite ruiniert.",
    "pcb_p2": "Eigentlich eher unter euren Händen.",

    "pcb_p7": "Ein freundliches Gesicht, um mir beim Löten Gesellschaft zu leisten.",
    "pcb_p8": "Ich werde die PCB-Dateien selbst nicht veröffentlichen, nicht vor der zweiten Version. Ich bin sehr stolz, aber gleichzeitig unsicher. Ich hoffe, die Fotos gefallen euch.",
    "keymap_h3": "Meine Tastenbelegung und andere persönliche Anpassungen",
    "keymap_p1": "Die Details zum Zusammenbau überspringe ich, die sind langweilig, es war einfach. (Abgesehen vom mühsamen Schmieren von Schaltern und Federn...) Nachdem sie zusammengebaut war und auf meinem Schreibtisch stand, war die Sunshine alles, was ich mir erhofft hatte. Ich richtete VIAL ein und flashte die Elite-Cs mit meiner Tastenbelegung. Meine Tastenbelegung ist ziemlich einfach, es ist wirklich einfacher, sie zu zeigen, als darüber zu reden. Colemak-DH und einige Ebenen, nichts Verrücktes. Die wichtigsten Anmerkungen sind, dass ich mich wohl dabei fühlte, Tastencodes für Normie-Tastaturen wie <kbd>=+</kbd> beizubehalten, anstatt sie zu trennen, weil es so einfach war, <kbd>SHIFT</kbd> zu jeder Kombination hinzuzufügen. Die wichtigste persönliche Anpassung, über die ich sprechen möchte, ist das Federgewicht. Meine alphanumerischen Tasten haben alle 25 Gramm, was sehr leicht ist. 2U-Tasten müssen schwerer sein, aber ich schiebe das Auslöten auf und behelfe mich. Deshalb verwendet meine Leertaste eine 1U-Taste. Die <kbd>HEEL</kbd>-Leisten verwenden jedoch fantastisch schwere 650-Gramm-Federn. Das macht sie außerordentlich bequem als Handgelenkstützen, aber gleichzeitig ist es möglich, sie bei Bedarf herunterzudrücken. YMMV, nicht alle Handgelenke wiegen gleich. Wenn ich keine schweren Federn verwenden würde, würde ich die Dinge in der Firmware umkehren, sodass SHIFT aktiviert wird, wenn die Leisten nicht mehr gedrückt sind. Oh, und ich benutze nie die zweite Alt-Taste. Wenn ihr Ideen habt, was ich stattdessen dorthin legen sollte, meldet euch bitte bei mir.",

Obwohl mir das Kyria-ähnliche Layout gut dient, denke ich, dass ich mehr Versatz möchte.",
    "plans_h3_features": "Feature-Creep",
    "plans_p2": "Ich möchte der nächsten Version Drehgeber hinzufügen, mindestens einen. Sie machen das Anhalten und Abspielen von Medien extrem praktisch und die Lautstärkeregelung ist auch super willkommen. Es gibt jedoch noch mehr Komfort zu haben. Zum einen liebe ich Guilty Gear, und manchmal spiele ich tatsächlich Strive, anstatt die Alben anzuhören, während ich andere Dinge tue. Ich denke, ein kleiner 8-Wege-Schalter könnte wirklich nett sein, wenn er gut passen würde. Ich bezweifle, dass er meinen Fightstick ersetzen würde, aber es wäre trotzdem wirklich süß. Abgesehen davon brauche ich eine Art Zeigegerät, für das ein 8-Wege-Schalter nicht geeignet ist. Eine Anordnung im Oddball-Stil wäre wirklich schön.",
    "plans_h3_production": "Produktionsreifes, professionell aussehendes Design",
    "plans_p3": "Ich möchte in der Lage sein, Pläne für die zweite Version zu veröffentlichen, die mit einer Dichtung in einem Gehäuse montiert ist (vielleicht sogar verkaufen 🤫), ich denke, eine neue Version würde davon profitieren, wenn die <kbd>HEEL</kbd>-Leisten eine separate Leiterplatte hätten, da auf der aktuellen Leiterplatte massiv Fläche verschwendet wird. Außerdem möchte ich den RP2040 on-board verwenden, anstatt etwas wie den Elite-C. Das hat offensichtliche Vorteile, die Kosten sind einer davon, aber ich möchte es tun, weil es einfach eleganter ist. Ich möchte auch einen besseren Weg für den Umgang mit den Mosfets und Kondensatoren für die Solenoidschaltung finden. Sie nehmen eine <i>Menge</i> Platz ein. Schließlich möchte ich niedliche ganzflächige Grafiken und besser verlegte Leiterbahnen haben. Ich hatte viele coole Ideen, die auf meiner Efeutute basierten, die ich nie umgesetzt habe, und ich würde ihnen gerne eine weitere Chance geben.",

    "intro_h2": "背景",
    "intro_p1": "昔からキーボードに興味がありました。6歳のとき、母の動かなくなったスミス・コロナSD 300を、修理も再組付けも不可能なほど細かく分解してしまいました。ごめんね、お母さん、ただどうやって動くのか知りたかっただけなんです…大人になるにつれて、私たちみんながそうであるように、インターネットでメカニカルキーボードについて知りました。必然的にその趣味の世界に出会い、組み立てるためにいくつかのキットを買いました。",
    "intro_p2": "Lily58が私の初めての分割キーボードになり、とても気に入りました。ロータリーエンコーダーの追加をどうやって失敗したかを知るために回路について学んだ後、最終的にはロータリーエンコーダーが2倍の量あるKeeb.ioのIrisに乗り換えました。人間工学キーボードがすぐに好きになったにもかかわらず、使っていたものにはいくつか問題がありました。手は大きいのですが、指はそれに比べてかなり短いのです。ほとんどの分割キーボードの4列のうち一番上の列は、私にとってはスペースの無駄遣いに感じられました。それに、小指は手全体を動かさないと上から2番目の列に届きませんでしたし、ましてや一番外側の列の上から2番目の列なんてとんでもないことでした。",
    "intro_p3": "つまり、Lilyには使えないキーが22個、Irisには20個あったのですが、それはIrisに最初からその使えないキーが2つなかったからに過ぎません。さらに、Irisのノブは気に入っていましたが、Lilyのような4つの親指キーがないのが寂しかったです。—もっとも、Lilyの4つ目の親指キーは少し押しにくかったのですが。—違う配置にする必要がありました。Ergodoxのようなキーボードには親指キーが複数列あるのを見ましたが、そのアイデアは好きになれませんでした。洗練されていないように見え、同じくらい押しにくそうでした。Kyriaの方がうまく処理しているように思えました。さらに、キーボードの高さのために手首をまっすぐに保つための何らかのリストレストが必要でした。変なフワフワした形状記憶フォームで解決している人もいれば、Cherry MXからKailh Chocに切り替えてPCBにケースを使わないことで解決している人も見かけました。しかし、私には別のアイデアがありました。それは、MXスイッチが提供する4mmの移動距離を失うことなく、キースイッチのために必要なだけ手を持ち上げることができるというものです。キーボードを使い、他の人が採用している戦略を観察し、設計の根拠についての記事を読むうちに、私にとって理想的なキーボードはどのようなものかを考え始めるようになりました。",

    "keymap_p1": "組み立ての詳細は省略します。退屈ですし、簡単でしたから。（スイッチとスプリングに骨の折れる潤滑作業は別として…）組み立てて机の上に置いたSunshineは、私が望んでいたすべてでした。VIALをセットアップし、Elite-Cに私のキーマップを書き込みました。私のキーマップはかなりシンプルで、話すよりも見せる方が簡単です。Colemak-DHといくつかのレイヤー、特別なことは何もありません。最も重要な点は、ノーミー向けのキーボードのような<kbd>=+</kbd>のキーコードを分離せずにそのままにしておくことに抵抗がなかったことです。これは、どの組み合わせにも<kbd>SHIFT</kbd>を追加するのが非常に簡単だったからです。話したい主な個人的な調整は、スプリングの重さです。私の英数字キーはすべて25グラムで、これは非常に軽いです。2Uキーはもっと重くする必要がありますが、はんだ除去を先延ばしにして、なんとかやっています。だから私のスペースバーは1Uキーを使っているのです。しかし、<kbd>HEEL</kbd>バーは驚くほど重い650グラムのスプリングを使用しています。これにより、リストレストとして非常に快適でありながら、必要なときには押し下げることが可能です。個人差がありますので、すべての手首が同じ重さではありません。もし重いスプリングを使っていなかったら、ファームウェアで設定を反転させて、バーが押されなくなったときにSHIFTが有効になるようにするでしょう。ああ、それと、あの2番目のaltキーはまったく使いません。代わりに入れるべきものについてアイデアがあれば、ぜひ教えてください。",
