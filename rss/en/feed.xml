                <p data-key="dv_p1">Utah's Dixie is where I restarted my photography hobby. I didn't get as many pictures of Washington and St. George as I might have taken if I had my camera when I first arrived. It's an incredibly distinct area that seems almost as if it were made for landscapes and cityscapes. I was living with my friend Aaron at the time and getting a lot of sun-damage.</p>

                <p data-key="dv_p2">I got my <a href="https://www.kenrockwell.com/nikon/d3.htm">Nikon D3</a> that month and a <a href="https://www.kenrockwell.com/nikon/105af.htm">105mm f/2.8 FX AF MICRO-NIKKOR macro lense.</a> The auto focus on this lense is very sluggish compared to newer lenses, it's also very soft wide-open. It is very cheap though, and shoots good portraits. Most of my early work with this lense is way too soft because I was getting to grips with it and it seemed fine from the camera monitor.</p>

                <p data-key="dv_p3">My Basil (Omori (2020)) plushy nestled in the lap of my teddy-bear Misha. Flanked by two Gondolas, one made by my friend Julia on the left, and another bought from KommandoStore and owned by my friend Aaron on the right.

                <p data-key="dv_p15">Aaron and I went to Vegas one last time for a weekend. We both got horrifically high fevers and I could barely walk or stay awake. I had horrifying dreams. A dark sphere I once dreamt I was trapped in as a child lay in my arms, weak and small, its suffocating might whittled away. It beckoned me to do things in a gentle, nudging fashion, softly reminding me of the suprising precision of one particular tool I had used once. I felt so sad for my precious sphere. I love my sphere. I'm glad Vegas built one.</p>

                <h1 id="title" data-key="ep_h1">Elizabeth Park Rose Garden, Hartford, Connecticut<br>| Nikon D3, 105mm f/2.8 FX AF MICRO-NIKKOR</h1>
                <p data-key="ep_p1">When I got back to Connecticut I went to a cool garden with my friend Julia. I used same camera-lens combo I started using in<a href="https://pelmeniboiler.github.io/dixie_and_vegas.html"> Utah</a>. I think was a good choice for the flowers and bugs, but next time I do stuff like this I'll borrow my dad's <a href="https://www.kenrockwell.com/nikon/d610.htm">D610</a> with a more landscape-oriented lens to get more of the garden layout because it's really cool. There were a lot of waterfowl as well, I wish I had managed to get sharper pictures of them.<br>I think I should look into using flickr to host these and embed them here instead of compressing them so much. There's so much detail lost...</p>

                <img src="https://pelmeniboiler.github.io/photos/sunshine/sunshine.png" alt="All is in your hands." class="article-image">
                <p data-key="sunshine_p1">The Sunshine Keyboard is a custom, ergonomic, split keyboard I designed and built from scratch. It is an experimental layout focused on minimizing finger travel and maximizing comfort by using a minimal number of keys arranged in layers and accessed through combos.</p>
                <p data-key="sunshine_p2">This project was a deep dive into keyboard design, from physical prototyping with cardboard to designing a custom PCB and programming the firmware. This article documents that journey.</p>

                <h2 id="TLDR" data-key="tldr_h2">Abstract (TL;DR)</h2>
                <p data-key="tldr_p1">I designed and built a custom split ergonomic keyboard with only 36 keys. It relies heavily on layers and key combinations (combos) to access all characters, which keeps my fingers on or near the home row at all times. I prototyped the layout with cardboard, designed a custom PCB with unique artwork, and programmed it using QMK firmware. It's weird, but it's comfortable. Check out the typing test video below:</p>

                <h2 id="Intro" data-key="intro_h2">Background &amp; Motivation</h2>
                <p data-key="intro_p1">Like many people who type all day, I've found standard keyboards to be uncomfortable. After trying several commercially available ergonomic keyboards, like the Lily58 pictured here, I found that while they were an improvement, they weren't perfect for me. Many still required uncomfortable finger movements and stretches.</p>
                <img src="https://pelmeniboiler.github.io/photos/sunshine/lily.png" alt="Okay maybe not UNUSABLE, but they're not convenient" class="article-image">
                <p data-key="intro_p2">I wanted something that was built for *my* hands, not the average hand. I was inspired by the minimalist keyboard community, particularly those using keyboards with very few keys (sub-40%). The philosophy is simple: why move your fingers to a key when you can bring the key to your fingers through layers?</p>
                <p data-key="intro_p3">This led me to a simple conclusion: to get the perfect keyboard for me, I'd have to design it myself.</p>

                <h2 id="Objectives" data-key="objectives_h2">Project Objectives</h2>
                <p data-key="objectives_p1">Before I started designing, I set out a clear list of goals for the project. These were guided by a central theory of keyboard ergonomics.</p>
                <h3 data-key="objectives_h3_theory">My Grand Unified Theory of Keyboard Comfort</h3>
                <h4 data-key="objectives_h4_phalanges">Phalanges First: Minimize Movement</h4>
                <img src="https://pelmeniboiler.github.io/photos/sunshine/hand%20anatomy.png" alt="HIGHLY scientific diagram of the hand" class="article-image">
                <p data-key="objectives_p2">The core idea is that fingers should not stretch or travel long distances. Each key should be located directly under a finger's natural resting position. The thumb, being the strongest and most flexible digit, should be responsible for activating layers and common modifiers like <kbd>Space</kbd>, <kbd>Enter</kbd>, and <kbd>Backspace</kbd>.</p>
                <h4 data-key="objectives_h4_combos">Combos and Layers: Reduce Key Count</h4>
                <p data-key="objectives_p3">With a limited number of keys, layers are essential. For example, holding down a thumb key might turn the home row `ASDF` into `1234`. Key combinations, or 'combos,' where you press two keys at once to trigger a different action, can further expand functionality without needing more physical keys. For example, pressing <kbd>J</kbd> and <kbd>K</kbd> together could output <kbd>Escape</kbd>.</p>
                <p data-key="objectives_p4">This led to the following concrete design goals:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li data-key="objectives_li1">3 rows and 5 columns per hand, plus a thumb cluster.</li>
                    <li data-key="objectives_li2">Aggressive column stagger to match natural finger lengths.</li>
                    <li data-key="objectives_li3">A comfortable, angled thumb cluster.</li>
                    <li data-key="objectives_li4">Heavy reliance on layers and combos to eliminate the need for number rows, function rows, or even some symbol keys.</li>
                    <li data-key="objectives_li5">Fully programmable firmware (QMK or ZMK).</li>
                    <li data-key="objectives_li6">A unique and personal aesthetic.</li>
                    <li data-key="objectives_li7">Must be a split design for shoulder-width posture.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2 id="Design" data-key="design_h2">The Design Process</h2>
                <p data-key="design_p1">My first concept, which I called the Type-22, was drawn up in a keyboard layout editor. It had a very aggressive pinky stagger and an early idea for the thumb arc.</p>
                <img src="https://pelmeniboiler.github.io/photos/sunshine/type-22.png" alt="First design." class="article-image">
                <p data-key="design_p2">However, a 2D layout on a screen doesn't tell you how it actually *feels*. For that, I needed to get physical.</p>
                
                <section>
                    <h3 id="CAD" data-key="cad_h3">CAD (Cardboard Aided Design)</h3>
                    <p data-key="cad_p1">Instead of immediately 3D printing a case or ordering a PCB, I turned to a cheaper and faster prototyping material: cardboard. I printed my layout at a 1:1 scale and glued it to a piece of cardboard.</p>
                    <img src="https://pelmeniboiler.github.io/photos/sunshine/cardboard%20assisted%20design.png" alt="Synthesis of Computer Aided and Cardboard Aided Design, CACAD" class="article-image gs">
                    <p data-key="cad_p2">I then painstakingly cut out switch holes. This allowed me to pop in real mechanical switches and keycaps to test the spacing and stagger.</p>
                    <img src="https://pelmeniboiler.github.io/photos/sunshine/cardboard%20assisted%20design%20mas.png" alt="Cutting this sucked there were tons of tiny squares" class="article-image gs"> 
                    <p data-key="cad_p3">This low-fidelity prototype was invaluable. I could immediately feel which columns were off, or if a thumb key was hard to reach. I made several of these cardboard prototypes, tweaking the design each time.</p>
                    <img src="https://pelmeniboiler.github.io/photos/sunshine/cardboard%203.png" alt="Cardboard sounds pretty good when you type on it, just saying." class="article-image gs"> 
                    <p data-key="cad_p4">As a side benefit, typing on cardboard actually sounds surprisingly nice.</p>

                    <h3 id="FinalFinalFinalV26FinalRealFinal-2" data-key="final_h3">Finalizing the Layout</h3>
                    <p data-key="final_p1">One of the first changes was to the thumb cluster. My initial design had the inner thumb key too far in, requiring an uncomfortable stretch.</p>
                    <img src="https://pelmeniboiler.github.io/photos/sunshine/type-22%20(3).png" alt="Moved the bar further" class="article-image"> 
                    <p data-key="final_p2">The cardboard prototype confirmed this. I adjusted the arc to be tighter and more natural to reach.</p>
                    <img src="https://pelmeniboiler.github.io/photos/sunshine/cardboard%20%204.png" alt="" class="article-image gs"> 
                    <p data-key="final_p3">Another iteration involved adjusting the pinky column. It turned out to be too low, so I raised it slightly.</p>
                    <img src="https://pelmeniboiler.github.io/photos/sunshine/very%20last.png" alt="" class="article-image">   
                    <p data-key="final_p4">After a few more tweaks, I arrived at a layout that felt comfortable and natural. This became the final design that I would base the PCB on.</p>
                    <img src="https://pelmeniboiler.github.io/photos/sunshine/cardboard%205.png" alt="" class="article-image gs"> 
                    <p data-key="final_p5">This final cardboard version was my trusty guide for the rest of the project.</p>

                    <h3 id="PCB" data-key="pcb_h3">Designing the PCB</h3>
                    <p data-key="pcb_p1">With the physical layout finalized, it was time to design the electronic brain of the keyboard: the Printed Circuit Board (PCB). I used KiCad for this process. For the PCB art, I chose the motto 'ALL IS IN YOUR HANDS'.</p>
                    <img src="https://pelmeniboiler.github.io/photos/sunshine/pcb0.png" alt="ALL IS IN YOUR HANDS. Get it? Literally in your hands..." class="article-image"> 
                    <p data-key="pcb_p2">The schematic is fairly simple for a keyboard. Each switch is part of a matrix, connected with a diode to prevent 'ghosting' (incorrect key presses being registered).</p>
                    <img src="https://pelmeniboiler.github.io/photos/sunshine/pcb4.png" alt="" class="article-image"> 
                    <p data-key="pcb_p3">I chose to use a Raspberry Pi Pico as the microcontroller because it's cheap, powerful, and well-supported by QMK firmware.</p>
                    <img src="https://pelmeniboiler.github.io/photos/sunshine/pcb2.png" alt="" class="article-image"> 
                    <p data-key="pcb_p4">The two halves of the keyboard are connected using a TRRS cable, which carries power and the data matrix signal.</p>
                    <img src="https://pelmeniboiler.github.io/photos/sunshine/pcb3.png" alt="" class="article-image">
                    <p data-key="pcb_p5">I added support for Kailh hot-swap sockets, which allow me to change switches easily without soldering.</p>
                    <img src="https://pelmeniboiler.github.io/photos/sunshine/pcb5.png" alt="" class="article-image">  
                    <p data-key="pcb_p6">After routing all the traces, which was like solving a puzzle, I added the silkscreen art and generated the Gerber files for manufacturing.</p>
                    <img src="https://pelmeniboiler.github.io/photos/sunshine/pcb6.png" alt="" class="article-image"> 
                    <p data-key="pcb_p7">I sent the files off to a manufacturer and, a few weeks later, the finished boards arrived!</p>
                    <p data-key="pcb_p8">Seeing the design go from a digital file to a physical object was incredibly rewarding.</p>

                    <p data-key="keymap_p1">A keyboard is nothing without a good keymap. I programmed mine in QMK. It features four primary layers: a base layer for letters, a layer for numbers, a layer for symbols, and a function layer for system controls and F-keys. The layers are accessed by the thumb keys. I also make extensive use of combos for common keys like Escape and Tab.</p>

                <p data-key="discoveries_p1">This project was a huge learning experience. Here are some of the key takeaways:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li data-key="discoveries_li1">Prototyping with cardboard is an essential, cheap, and effective step for ergonomic designs.</li>
                    <li data-key="discoveries_li2">The angle and position of the thumb cluster are the most critical elements for comfort.</li>
                    <li data-key="discoveries_li3">There is a significant learning curve to using layers and combos, but it becomes second nature after a couple of weeks.</li>
                    <li data-key="discoveries_li4">Designing a PCB is less intimidating than it seems, thanks to modern open-source software like KiCad.</li>
                    <li data-key="discoveries_li5">There is no 'one-size-fits-all' solution for keyboards. Personalization is key.</li>
                </ul>
                <img src="https://pelmeniboiler.github.io/photos/sunshine/cardboard%206.png" alt="Kind of tempted to do this with hot glue..." class="article-image gs"> 
                <p data-key="discoveries_p2">I also discovered that a case filled with silicone provides excellent sound dampening, but I am still very tempted to just build the final case by layering hot glue, just to see what happens.</p>

                <h3 data-key="plans_h3_layout">Layout Revisions (Sunshine V2)</h3>
                <p data-key="plans_p1">For a second version, I would experiment with adding a bit of tenting (angling the halves upwards in the middle) and maybe try a more aggressive curvature for the keywell, similar to a Dactyl or Kinesis Advantage keyboard.</p>
                <h3 data-key="plans_h3_features">New Hardware Features</h3>
                <p data-key="plans_p2">I'm interested in adding a small OLED screen to display the current layer, or perhaps a small trackball or trackpad under the thumb to eliminate the need for a mouse.</p>
                <h3 data-key="plans_h3_production">Production &amp; Sharing</h3>
                <p data-key="plans_p3">I plan to release all the design files (KiCad, case models) on GitHub soon. I don't have plans for a group buy, but I hope the files will be useful for others looking to build their own perfect keyboard.</p>

                <p data-key="bye_p1">Thanks for reading about my keyboard journey! Building the Sunshine keyboard has been one of the most challenging and rewarding projects I've ever undertaken. It's not just a tool, but a reflection of a philosophy about how we interact with our computers. If you have any questions, feel free to reach out.</p>
