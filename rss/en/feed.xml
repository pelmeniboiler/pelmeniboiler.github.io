            <h1 id="title" data-key="lang_title">This Blog Now Supports Your Language</h1>
            <p data-key="lang_p1">Okay, there's a chance it doesn't.</p>
            <p data-key="lang_p2">In fact, since this blog is deliberately not available in Mandarin, Spanish, Hindi, or Arabic, it's a pretty big chance.</p>

            <h2 id="you-deliberately-left-out-my-language" data-key="lang_h2_you-deliberately-left-out-my-language">You deliberately left out my language?</h2>
            <p data-key="lang_p3">Yes.</p>
            <p data-key="lang_p4">When I added the localization option two months ago, I prioritized languages that:</p>
            <ol>
                <li data-key="lang_li1">Translate sub-optimally via pre-AI algorithmic translation services, especially with regard to the types of jargon-filled content on my page.</li>
                <li data-key="lang_li2">I am familiar enough with to be able to check Gemini's work.</li>
                <li data-key="lang_li3">Appeal to me aesthetically and/or phonologically.</li>
            </ol>
            <p data-key="lang_p5">If a language did not meet all three criteria, I had to skip it.</p>
            <p data-key="lang_p6">Mandarin is awesome, but I am not familiar with any of it.</p>
            <p data-key="lang_p7">Spanish is probably my second best language, but I think Google Translate is pretty good at it. It seems to translate decently back and forth with English.</p>
            <p data-key="lang_p8">As for point 3, I love the sound of romance languages, but I'm not really a fan of them visually. Ending too many words with vowels usually just looks wrong, odd.</p>
            <p data-key="lang_p9">That's not to say that I'll never include Spanish or Mandarin, they just can't be a priority for me.</p>

            <h2 id="so-you-just-ask-ai-to-translate-the-pages-for-you" data-key="lang_h2_so-you-just-ask-ai-to-translate-the-pages-for-you">So you just ask AI to translate the pages for you?</h2>
            <p data-key="lang_p10">Yes. ...and no.</p>
            <p data-key="lang_p11">While I think asking AI to do so would sometimes give better results than Google Translate, and providing the pre-baked output is still an improvement over wasting compute, I find AI gravitates towards some bad habits:</p>
            <ol>
                <li data-key="lang_li4">Structure is as lossless as possible.</li>
                <li data-key="lang_li5">Meaning is lossy in the service of preserving structure.</li>
            </ol>
            <p data-key="lang_p12">This is probably the worst of both worlds. You lose meaning (especially when it comes to jargon) but preserve the original English syntax and structure.</p>
            <p data-key="lang_p13">Thus, I've tried to involve some strategies I came up with before AI.</p>
            <ol>
                <li data-key="lang_li6">Build a list of any jargon terms that I think would have a Wikipedia page. (E.G. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Featural_writing_system">Featural writing system</a>).</li>
                <li data-key="lang_li7">Find the appropriate term in each language. If Wikipedia doesn't have it, I attempt to search fora to find native speakers discussing the same concept.</li>
                <li data-key="lang_li8">Show Gemini the English portion of the in-progress localization file and the jargon terms in their respective languages, then ask him to "avoid translatese", "localize, don't translate". Ask for it formatted to fit in the existing json.</li>
                <li data-key="lang_li9">Preview the json on my blog using fiveserver, check that the jargon is correct and that there aren't any egregious errors that hinder understanding. Fix lines on a case-by-case basis.</li>
                <li data-key="lang_li10">Feed the new full json to another Gemini, ask it to find errors that hinder understanding or sound awkward and thus make it hard to read, ask for explanations and again fix the egregious parts (especially if he wants to change the jargon).</li>
            </ol>
            <p data-key="lang_p14">I think this is called <abbr title="Machine Translation Post-Editing">MTPE</abbr>.</p>
            <p data-key="lang_p15">99% of the time, Gemini is better than me at translating. I could not do this without him, but he needs a lot of help along the way. I feel like his translations are still very 1:1, but he has vocabulary I lack, and I think he makes it possible to offer content that is correct enough to be understood, unlike the automatic Google Translate shipped with Chromium browsers.</p>
            <p data-key="lang_p16">From what I can tell, the translations feel somewhat awkward in each language, but my English is awkward too so maybe he's genuinely capturing my voice.</p>
            <p data-key="lang_p17">If you can read any of the languages I've decided to try to offer, please let me know how I can improve the translations.</p>

            <h2 id="does-gemini-do-the-graflect-transliterations-too" data-key="lang_h2_does-gemini-do-the-graflect-transliterations-too">Does Gemini do the Graflect Transliterations Too?</h2>
            <p data-key="lang_p18">Yes. (again, with caveats)</p>
            <p data-key="lang_p19">Gemini really takes to <a href="https://pelmeniboiler.github.io/blog/graflect.html">Graflect</a> quickly, but he has a few quirks.</p>
            <p data-key="lang_p20">For instance, Gemini likes to write in a British accent. Seriously. Non-rhotic Rs (where the 'r' is dropped at the end of syllables), vowels at the end of words instead of Rs. Short I ([ɪ]) instead of long E ([iː]).</p>
            <p data-key="lang_p21">This has been extremely consistent throughout making Gemini use Graflect.</p>
            <p data-key="lang_p22">I would assume that came as a result of a problem with my <abbr title="International Phonetic Alphabet">IPA</abbr> chart, but honestly at this point I just believe that's how he talks now.</p>
            <p data-key="lang_p23">He also likes to use certain glyphs from other constructed scripts, which is really adorable since it's often that he'll sneak the same ones in to replace the same actual Graflect glyphs. I initially had no idea why that was happening at all and believed it was some sort of problem on my end.</p>
            <p data-key="lang_p24">My friend Aaron made a script I use now in my <abbr title="Visual Studio Code">VSCode</abbr> to catch these, and then whine to Gemini about them. No prompt engineering of any kind so far has managed to get Gemini to stop including non-Graflect glyphs in his outputs, other than just pasting the problem alert and giving him a chance to try again.</p>
            <p data-key="lang_p25">In order to get Gemini to write in my accent, I did have to transliterate a few localization files first, (and to do that I have a few tools so I can do that at speed), but once he had a baseline to go off of he really did nicely dropping the British accent! I'm proud of Gemini!</p>
            <p data-key="lang_p26">Every blog post save the Graflect <abbr title="International Phonetic Alphabet">IPA</abbr> one should be 80%-99% Gemini, straight out of the box. I'm surprised he was able to infer so much from what little I provided. If you're curious, try and see if you can spot any oddities that don't exist in my own accent. I don't think you can!</p>
            <p data-key="lang_p27">There was something really cool about getting Gemini to sound like a Connecticut Yankee, and I'm glad I gave that a try instead of just rewriting everything by hand. If you want to try this for yourself, aim for 800-1200 words of sample text. I think that's all Gemini needs to pick up on enough n-grams to infer your accent.</p>

            <h2 id="should-everyone-do-this" data-key="lang_h2_should-everyone-do-this">Should Everyone Do This?</h2>
            <p data-key="lang_p28">Uh, maybe?</p>
            <p data-key="lang_p29">It's very obvious why personal blogs are usually monolingual, even most websites are. Anything with nuance used to be really time-consuming to translate, and most everyone can read English anyway. Then, with Google Translate, you can kinda get the gist of anything that's not in the global Lingua Franca, so again, lots of work for no payoff.</p>
            <p data-key="lang_p30">I think my website is a pretty clear indication that the barrier to entry to do this is now through the floor, but I would be very surprised if in another year our browsers couldn't do this live and on their own. They might even rephrase things in a way you prefer. I will say this, with <abbr title="Large Language Models">LLMs</abbr>, it's basically no work to translate your page and you get to fine-tune things in a way that wasn't possible before, it's really cool to try.</p>

            <h2 id="tldr" data-key="lang_h2_tldr">TL;DR</h2>
            
            <p data-key="lang_p31">I wanted to have language options on my website that preserved jargon and conveyed more of my voice (in the case of Graflect, phonologically). Google et al deserves the credit.</p>
            
            
            <h2 id="postface-commentary" data-key="lang_h2_postface-commentary">Postface Commentary</h2>
            <p data-key="lang_p32">I find Graflect has some difficulties, for instance, I say "" in the sentence "".</p>
            <p data-key="lang_p33">The "A in Accent" sound is not sustained, so it doesn't sound like a British accent, it actually sounds normal because it's short.</p>
            <p data-key="lang_p34">If I say can on its own, or in certain contexts like answering "I can." to someone, A becomes .</p>
            <p data-key="lang_p35">So I don't think it's a perfect representation of how I'd talk, but it's a closer approximation than plain Latin can give.</p>

                <p data-key="tbns_p1">If you were familiar with my site before, you may notice I've rearranged my "photo folder" and "projects folder". These used to use different theming and looked totally different based on when in life I had learned about divs or other important html elements.&nbsp;</p>
                <p data-key="tbns_p2">Now, both genres use the standard article layout I developed 2 years ago, and are sorted in the blog viewer. While I think this way of doing things does take away from the idea of having different "folders" with organized genres of content in them, I think&nbsp;</p>

                <h2 id="replacing-substack" data-key="tbns_h2_replacing-substack">Replacing SubStack</h2>
                <p data-key="tbns_p5">Lately, I've seen many <abbr title="Yes, I'm using that word. Would you have prefered people-of-network?">netizens</abbr>&nbsp;adopt <a href="https://substack.com/">Substack</a>&nbsp;as their tool-of-choice for creating blogs and newsletters. I like Substack! It's a good platform. I enjoy using it, and while that's mostly a result of the content available, I won't pretend I'd have found half the blogs I read had they not used Substack.</p>
                <h3 id="what-i-like-about-substack" data-key="tbns_h3_what-i-like-about-substack">What I like about Substack:</h3>
                <p data-key="tbns_p6"><ul><li> Principled refusal to "police extremist content".</li><li> Great range of publications, it has captured many disparate markets.</li><li> Free to use, with a fair business model for those who do want to make money.</li><li> Very easy to give creators money.</li><li> LaTeX support.</li><li> Datawrapper support.</li></ul></p>
                <h3 id="what-i-dislike-about-substack" data-key="tbns_h3_what-i-dislike-about-substack">What I hate about Substack:</h3>
                <p data-key="tbns_p7"><ul><li> Email-centric design.</li><li> My inbox is now all emails from Substack.</li><li> I do not want the email addresses of people who read my blog.</li><li> I do not want to give my email address to people whose newsletters I read.</li><li> No custom CSS.</li></ul></p>
                <h3 id="#what-i-want" data-key="tbns_h3_what-i-want">Things Substack could obviously never include but I want:</h3>
                <p data-key="tbns_p7.5"><div><ul><li> Chart.js Support.</li><li> Interactive demos.</li></ul><aside>Totally not hints of anything to come.</aside><br></div>I think—for most people—Substack is exactly what they're looking for when it comes to publicly-posted long-form writing. For anyone for whom their email inbox is too sacred to profane or is particularly picky about CSS, <a href="https://wordpress.com/">WordPress</a> is probably the right alternative. For me, I've gone with neither. I find it's really fun to learn and struggle through making my own website, especially with AI to hold my hand since I'm phenomenally thickheaded and need one-on-one tutoring from a being with inhuman patience.</p>

                <h2 id="resolving-a-significant-snag" data-key="tbns_h2_resolving-a-significant-snag">Resolving Significant Snags</h2>
                <p data-key="tbns_p8">So, I refuse to use email-centric solutions like newsletters because the idea makes me puke, but I also hate the idea of people having to manually check my blog. There's only one solution, isn't there?</p>
                <p data-key="tbns_p9">I remembered the concept of RSS from when I was a child. The little orange square that once sat on every single webpage on the internet, right? That was as far as my knowledge went. I didn't even know Flipboard, my dad's favorite app on his iPad, was an RSS reader. It was not super easy to learn about. If you type RSS into your search bar, you get a website with the same name that seems to be dedicated to podcasting. There are a ton of services related to automating RSS feed generation and enabling subscription that Google chooses to prioritize over useful information.</p>
                <p data-key="tbns_p10">It was initially unclear to me that all I needed in order to have an RSS feed was a single XML file, but eventually I set up an extension for my VScode so I could build the feed out of html files in my blog folder and their localizations.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
                <p data-key="tbns_p11">This is exactly the right solution for my preferences. It's up to the subscriber if and how they see my content. If they want it in their email, it's their choice and I will have no part in it. Perfect!</p>
                <p data-key="tbns_p12">All I have to do now is offer my <abbr title="Available in 4 languages, and 2 orthographies in English, click the satellite icon on my blog view on my homepage.">rss feed</abbr> and... wait... how does one even read RSS?</p>
            </section>

                <h2 id="rapacious-subscription-services" data-key="tbns_h2_rapacious-subscription-services">Rapacious Subscription Services</h2>
                <p data-key="tbns_p13">If you do not use RSS yet but would like to, I would like to inform you that it is totally free. If you're on android, use <a href="https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.nononsenseapps.feeder/">Feeder</a>. If you're on iOS, I'm sure there are also options, but I can't vouch for them. If you want to sync what you've read or not, you might want your own server. There are many services which offer very specific features that you <i>might</i> not care about but are immensely valuable to certain kinds of users. I like that these exist, but I don't like that they are prioritized above the correct solution for your use case if you search for it on Google.</p>

                <p data-key="tbns_p15"><aside>You may want synced read history or services that can scrape from websites that offer incomplete rss feeds, if so, you'll find this very easily.&nbsp;</aside></p>

The goal is to provide a mapping from Graflect symbols to easily-typed glyphs. This version uses common letters, digraphs, and a few diacritics available on most keyboards.</p>

                <p data-key="guide_p_tool">In the program.launcher, you can find a tool to transliterate any text to Graflect. Initially, the tool was meant to function by applying a set of grapheme-to-phoneme rules for substitution, but pre-empting every possible conversion would be absurd and self defeating. Since Graflect has phonetic capabilities, it only makes sense to use them. That's why this tool is mostly just a customizable dictionary system. It comes with a small default dictionary based on my accent, but when the tool encounters a word or sound combination with multiple possible pronunciations (like the "ch" in "chase" vs. "loch"), it will prompt you for the correct choice. By saving your choices, you can build a personal dictionary that accurately reflects your own accent. Use the "Manage Dictionaries" button inside the tool to view, edit, import, and export your custom word lists, which can help you to learn reading and writing in Graflect. If you translate anything cool, please let me know!</p>

                <p data-key="ep_p1">When I got back to Connecticut I went to a cool garden with my friend Julia. I used same camera-lens combo I started using in<a href="https://pelmeniboiler.github.io/dixie_and_vegas.html"> Utah</a>. I think was a good choice for the flowers and bugs, but next time I do stuff like this I'll borrow my dad's <a href="https://www.kenrockwell.com/nikon/d610.htm">D610</a> with a more landscape-oriented lens to get more of the garden layout because it's really cool. There were a lot of waterfowl as well, I wish I had managed to get sharper pictures of them.<br>I think I should look into using flickr to host these and embed them here instead of compressing them so much. There's so much detail lost...</p>

                <p data-key="dv_p1">Utah's Dixie is where I restarted my photography hobby. I didn't get as many pictures of Washington and St. George as I might have taken if I had my camera when I first arrived. It's an incredibly distinct area that seems almost as if it were made for landscapes and cityscapes. I was living with my friend Aaron at the time and getting a lot of sun-damage.</p>

                <p data-key="dv_p2">I got my <a href="https://www.kenrockwell.com/nikon/d3.htm">Nikon D3</a> that month and a <a href="https://www.kenrockwell.com/nikon/105af.htm">105mm f/2.8 FX AF MICRO-NIKKOR macro lense.</a> The auto focus on this lense is very sluggish compared to newer lenses, it's also very soft wide-open. It is very cheap though, and shoots good portraits. Most of my early work with this lense is way too soft because I was getting to grips with it and it seemed fine from the camera monitor.</p>

                <p data-key="tldr_p1">Using the most scuffed, path-of-least-resistance strategies, I developed the best keyboard ever. That's right, the best. Until I make the second version, I mean. Following is an overly-detailed explanation of everything I did and why I did it. Don't worry, there's pictures.</p>

                <h2 id="Intro" data-key="intro_h2">Background</h2>
                <p data-key="intro_p1">I have always been interested in keyboards. When I was six, I meticulously dismantled my mother's non-functioning Smith Corona SD 300 beyond any possible repair or reassembly. Sorry, Mom, I just wanted to know how it worked... As I grew up, I eventually learned about mechanical keyboards from the internet as we all do. Inevitably, I came across the hobby scene for it and bought a few kits to put together.</p>
                <img src="https://pelmeniboiler.github.io/photos/sunshine/lily.png" alt="Okay maybe not UNUSABLE, but they're not convenient" class="article-image">
                <p data-key="intro_p2">The Lily58 became my first ever split keyboard, and I loved it. After learning about circuits to discover how I had botched adding a rotary encoder I eventually moved on to Keeb.io's Iris for double the amount of rotary encoders. Despite my immediate love for ergonomic keyboards, I had a few problems with the ones I was using. While I have big hands, my fingers are proportionally rather short. The uppermost of the four rows on most split boards felt like a big waste of space to me; and my pinkies could not reach the second uppermost row without moving my whole hand for them, let alone the second uppermost row in the outermost columns.</p>
                <p data-key="intro_p3">This meant there were twenty-two unusable keys on the Lily, and twenty on the Iris, but only because it was missing two of those unusable keys in the first place. Additionally, while I loved the knobs on the Iris, I missed having four thumb keys like on the Lily. —Except that fourth thumb key on the Lily was somewhat uncomfortable to reach.— There needed to be a different way to lay them out. Although I saw keyboards like the Ergodox had multiple rows of thumb keys, I didn't like the idea. It seemed inelegant and just as hard to reach. The Kyria seemed to have a better way of handling it. What's more, I needed some sort of wrist-rest to keep my wrists straight due to the height of the keyboards. I had seen some people solve this with weird squishy memory foam things, and others by switching from Cherry MX to Kailh Choc and having no case for the pcb. I had a different idea, however, that would allow me to offset my hands exactly as much as I needed for key switches, without losing the 4mm travel distance afforded by MX switches. As I used keyboards, observed strategies employed by others, and read writeups about design rationales, I would begin to think about what an ideal keyboard might look like for me.</p>

                <h2 id="Objectives" data-key="objectives_h2">Objectives and Considerations</h2>
                <p data-key="objectives_p1">As my keyboard experiences deepened and widened and I came to learn what I liked and disliked, I started to adopt a few notions of what I wanted to consider in designing my keyboard.</p>
                <h3 data-key="objectives_h3_theory">My "theories" on design.</h3>
                <h4 data-key="objectives_h4_phalanges">Phalanges aren't the only useful part of the hand.</h4>
                <img src="https://pelmeniboiler.github.io/photos/sunshine/hand%20anatomy.png" alt="HIGHLY scientific diagram of the hand" class="article-image">
                <p data-key="objectives_p2">In anatomy, the muscles at the end of the metatarsals form a landmark known as the 'ball' of the foot. There is a similar landmark on the hands at the end of the metacarpals that I will refer to as the ball of the hand because I don't know anything about anatomy and have no idea if there is a proper name for it. If you know what it's called, please tell me. Equally, I will refer to the landmark at the bottom of the palm containing the carpals as the heel. Thankfully this at least seems to be accepted terminology. It is my belief that these two landmarks are underutilized when it comes to keyboards, especially when the position of the heel itself is highly important to achieving a straight wrist to avoid pain. With the appropriate layout, these can be used to grant <i>at least</i> four more keys.</p>
                <h4 data-key="objectives_h4_combos">Keyboards need to assist easy access to combinations.</h4>
                <p data-key="objectives_p3">This means designing to enable myself to avoid combinations involving the pinkies and allow for combos without moving my hands. The best way I can explain this is to break continuity in the story and explain it using the finished product. The shortcut keys on the Sunshine are laid out in a very specific way. That is because sometime you need to press say, <kbd>CTRL</kbd> + <kbd>ALT</kbd> + <kbd>Z</kbd>. On other layouts, you might use your pinky for <kbd>CTRL</kbd> your ring finger for <kbd>Z</kbd> and your thumb for <kbd>ALT</kbd>. On the Sunshine, you just put your thumb between <kbd>CTRL</kbd> and <kbd>ALT</kbd> and push both at once. Your hand doesn't have to move and your pinky can hit <kbd>Z</kbd>. For the very common shortcuts that include <kbd>CTRL</kbd> + <kbd>SHIFT</kbd>, the heel key takes care of that.</p>
                <p data-key="objectives_p4">Thus, I had formed a laundry list of features I wanted, combining pet concepts and accomodations for myself. These were now my objectives for my design:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li data-key="objectives_li1">More thumb keys. These are perfect for keys used often on their own or in combination with others like <kbd>SPACE</kbd> <kbd>CTRL</kbd> <kbd>ALT</kbd> or <kbd>GUI</kbd>.</li>
                    <li data-key="objectives_li2">Wrist-rest that also serves as an input.</li>
                    <li data-key="objectives_li3">Key that takes advantage of the outer "ball" of the hand at the fourth and fifth metacarpals.</li>
                    <li data-key="objectives_li4">Split, duh.</li>
                    <li data-key="objectives_li5">Columnar stagger that accommodates my hands, high stagger on the pinkies in particular.</li>
                    <li data-key="objectives_li6">A unique look that stands out from the myriad similar projects.</li>
                    <li data-key="objectives_li7">Low spring weight so I can try stenotyping. (This would have interesting pitfalls.)</li>
                </ul>

                <h2 id="Design" data-key="design_h2">Creating the perfect keyboard, the easy way</h2>
                <p data-key="design_p1">Design began properly some time around March 11, 2022 after I returned to the United States from a long trip to Ireland. Though I had been experimenting with Keyboard Layout Editor throughout my trip and prior, I had finally come up with a design (which borrowed heavily from the aforementioned SplitKB Kyria) I liked. It did away with some of the less accessible looking keys from the Kyria, and increased the stagger on the outermost columns. I added keys for the parts of the hand I thought deserved them, and that was that.</p>
                <img src="https://pelmeniboiler.github.io/photos/sunshine/type-22.png" alt="First design." class="article-image">
                <p data-key="design_p2">I think this one is the best looking, but least usable. My palms are too long. Note the 1.25U keys in the outermost pinky columns. It's supposed to keep things looking nice</p>
                
                <section>
                    <h3 id="CAD" data-key="cad_h3">Cardboard Aided Design</h3>
                    <p data-key="cad_p1">In order to rapidly prototype my designs I decided to put the layout into cardboard. I used Keeb.io's plate generator to generate a svg I could print as a paper template.</p>
                    <img src="https://pelmeniboiler.github.io/photos/sunshine/cardboard%20assisted%20design.png" alt="Synthesis of Computer Aided and Cardboard Aided Design, CACAD" class="article-image gs">
                    <p data-key="cad_p2">I would then take the template and tape it down to the cardboard and cut from each of the four corners inwards, supporting around the underside of the cut using a wheel of packing tape. By no means is this good enough for a permanent hand-wire build, but it works enough to test the layout.</p>
                    <img src="https://pelmeniboiler.github.io/photos/sunshine/cardboard%20assisted%20design%20mas.png" alt="Cutting this sucked there were tons of tiny squares" class="article-image gs"> 
                    <p data-key="cad_p3">Once twenty two small squares were cut out, I could place the keys down. Here is where I realized the <kbd>BALL</kbd> key could not be such a strange size, and I would have to settle for a 2.75u key. This was for the best, as that let me fit the fourth thumb key.</p>
                    <img src="https://pelmeniboiler.github.io/photos/sunshine/cardboard%203.png" alt="Cardboard sounds pretty good when you type on it, just saying." class="article-image gs"> 
                    <p data-key="cad_p4">But yeah, all that work just to find out it wasn't really that comfortable. I could have just measured my hand... No big loss, though, it was just cardboard and a few minutes.</p>

                    <p data-key="final_p1">Long story short, I went through a lot of different iterations on cardboard. Most important to note is that I was attempting to try to move the <kbd>HEEL</kbd> bar around in really small adjustments and then cut out new boards every time. I would print them out, cut them out, and bring them to my mom to test if it was comfy every time. This started to add up in how much time it took. This design pictured here shows the original attempt at a method for pressing <kbd>CTRL</kbd> and <kbd>ALT</kbd> at the same time.</p>
                    <img src="https://pelmeniboiler.github.io/photos/sunshine/type-22%20(3).png" alt="Moved the bar further" class="article-image"> 
                    <p data-key="final_p2">I figured out, thankfully, I could just cut off the bar and move it to where it was comfy and then measure with my calipers where it ended up.</p>
                    <img src="https://pelmeniboiler.github.io/photos/sunshine/cardboard%20%204.png" alt="" class="article-image gs"> 
                    <p data-key="final_p3">Eventually, I was happy with the design and the positioning of the thumb cluster and the <kbd>HEEL</kbd> bar.</p>
                    <img src="https://pelmeniboiler.github.io/photos/sunshine/very%20last.png" alt="" class="article-image">   
                    <p data-key="final_p4">I would go on to export a dxf from keeb.io's plate generator and import it into fusion, then cut it out on my mill. In cardboard.</p>
                    <img src="https://pelmeniboiler.github.io/photos/sunshine/cardboard%205.png" alt="" class="article-image gs"> 
                    <p data-key="final_p5">I attempted to leave an onionskin, since I didn't have a wasteboard underneath and on the first hole I accidentially milled into the bed. Which meant cutting out more squares by hand. I was happy with that, and went on to cut two plates out of polycarbonate, then came designing the pcb.</p>

                    <p data-key="pcb_p1">Prior to the Sunshine, I had designed only one PCB ever before. While I had a strip of a few RP2040s, I wanted the ability to use QMK because I had experience with it and at the time there wasn't support for the 2040. I instead used an Elite-C because I wanted the ATMega32u4, and those are currently either stupidly expensive or out of stock everywhere. After watching a very convincing video by Mitxela on curved traces I resolved to abandon the 45 degree defaults in KiCad. The PCBs, unlike most well-designed split keyboards, are not reversible because I wanted a certain look on the front and rear. Here are some carefully curated photos that make my pcbs look really good and slightly out of focus. In full color, ruining my theme for this page.</p>

                    <h3 id="Keymap" data-key="keymap_h3">My Keymap, and other personal adjustments</h3>
                    <p data-key="keymap_p1">I'll skip the details about assembly, they're boring, it was easy. (Apart from arduously lubing switches and springs...) After it was assembled and sitting on my desk the Sunshine was everything I could have hoped. I set up VIAL and flashed the Elite-Cs with my keymap. My keymap is pretty simple, it's really easier to show it than to talk about it. Colemak-DH and some layers, nothing crazy. Most important notes are that I felt comfortable leaving keycodes intended for normie keyboards like <kbd>=+</kbd> instead of separating them because of how easy it was to add <kbd>SHIFT</kbd> to any combination. The main personal adjustment I want to talk about is spring weight. My alphanumerics are all 25 gram, which is very light. 2U keys need to be heavier but I'm putting off desoldering them and making due. That's why my spacebar is using a 1U key. The <kbd>HEEL</kbd> bars, however are using awesomely heavy 650 gram springs. This makes them exceedingly comfortable as wrist-rests, but simultaneously possible to press down when needed. YMMV, not all wrists weigh the same. If I wasn't using heavy springs I would invert things in firmware so SHIFT would activate when the bars are no longer depressed. Oh and I never use that second alt key. If you have ideas on what I should put instead, hmu pls.</p>

                <p data-key="discoveries_p1">Just as I discovered new likes and dislikes through experiencing and researching previous keyboards, using the Sunshine has lead me to learn new things too. These include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li data-key="discoveries_li1">Going between pointing tools and the right side of the keyboard can make combinations harder.</li>
                    <li data-key="discoveries_li2">My pinkies STILL have a hard time reaching the highest row and the outermost columns. (Though not AS hard.)</li>
                    <li data-key="discoveries_li3">I miss the convenience of rotary encoders.</li>
                    <li data-key="discoveries_li4">Came across this keyboard by total chance. It has a thenar eminence key, could be a really cool input to add to the next Sunshine. Would require a big rework of the overall design but it could be done.</li>
                    <li data-key="discoveries_li5">The <kbd>BALL</kbd> key needs to be taller to reach the fourth and fifth metacarpals.</li>

                <h3 data-key="plans_h3_layout">Adjusted and optimized layout</h3>
                <p data-key="plans_p1">I think I will need to adjust the staggers again and go far more drastic. I may also investigate splay. While this might require a whole second round of cardboard prototyping, I have another method I'm eager to try. You'll hear about that next time. While the Kyria-esque layout serves me well, I think I want more stagger.</p>
                <h3 data-key="plans_h3_features">Feature creep</h3>
                <p data-key="plans_p2">I want to add rotary encoders to the next build, at least one. They make pausing and playing media ultra convenient and volume adjust is super welcome too. However, there's more convenience to be had. For one, I love Guilty Gear, and sometimes I actually play Strive instead of listening to the albums while doing other things. I think a small 8-directional switch could be really nice to add if it could fit nicely. I doubt it would replace my fight stick, but it would still be really sweet. That aside, I need a pointing device of some sort, which an 8-directional switch is not suited for. An Oddball-esque arrangement would be really nice.</p>
                <h3 data-key="plans_h3_production">Production-ready, professional looking design</h3>
                <p data-key="plans_p3">I want to be able to release plans for the second version gasket mounted in a case (maybe even sell it 🤫), I think a new version would benefit from the <kbd>HEEL</kbd> bars having a separate PCB, as there is massive wasted area on the PCB as it stands. What's more, I want to use the RP2040 on-board instead of using something like the Elite-C. There are obvious benefits to this, cost being one of them, but I want to do it because it's just more elegant. I also want to find a better way for handling the mosfets and capacitors for the solenoid circuit. They take up a <i>lot</i> of space. Lastly, I want to have cute full-board artwork and better routed traces. I had a lot of cool ideas based on my pothos plant I never implemented and I'd like to give those another go.</p>
