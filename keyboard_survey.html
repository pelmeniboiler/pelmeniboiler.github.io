                <h2 id="Gary Huffmaster">&ensp;Interview with Gary Huffmaster of Meridian Community College</h2>
                <p>Gary Huffmaster is a media production student at Meridian Community College, </p>
                <h3 id="Gary's Keyboard">&emsp;What keyboard do you use on a day to day basis?</h3>
                <p>“I use an Amazon Basics keyboard that is currently only purchasable on amazon through a bundle with an Amazon basics mouse, which I do not own or use. It is very servicable and I have had zero issues using it in the many years I have been doing so.”</p>
                <h3 id="Frequency of Use">&emsp;How much do you use your keyboard every day?</h3>
                <p>“I use my computer honestly too much. I don't know exactly how much I use it every day, but I send a lot of messages to my friends over discord and type a lot of things into browsers. And I play games on it. Basically, I use it a lot more than the average person does.”</p>
                <h3 id="On Alternative Layouts">&emsp;Do you see yourself ever learning an optimized key layout like Colemak-DH?</h3>
                <p>“I don't see myself ever learning an alternate key layout. QWERTY is so widespread that it has become the unbreakable standard in keyboards. Any new PC or normal keyboard or even smart phone you buy will have QWERTY as the default. If by some crazy chance, an alternative layout breaks through, that is when I will consider learning it. But as for now, there I have no reason to impede my typing (an every day activity for me) by trying to learn a layout that would only be on my personal computer.”</p>
                <h3 id="Wrist Pain">&emsp;Do you experience tightness in your wrist from long periods of work?</h3>
                <p>“I personally don't notice any tightness. That could be because I'm just used to it, but it could also be the sheer amount of stimming I do with my hands giving them an adequate enough workout to where it relieves all the pain.”</p>
                <h3 id="Factors in Decision">&emsp;How much does the time it would take to learn Colemak factor into that decision?</h3>
                <p>“I'd say it factors in a good amount. The amount of time that my daily typing would be impeded by having to backspace and retype things and looking at the keyboard would just be annoying. I already type in a weird method I invented because I didn't want to learn normally in middleschool, I don't want to have to develop this again.”</p>
