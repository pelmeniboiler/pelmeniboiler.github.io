  <h1>Sunshine Experimental Keyboard</h1>
  <img src="sunshine.png" alt="All is in your hands.">
  <p>A unique and ergonomic column stagger split keyboard developed to comfortably utilize the entire hand by way of palm and wrist keys. Also, up to four solenoids because I like loud noises.</p>

 <h2 id="TLDR">Abstract, a fancy term for T.L.D.R.</h2>
  <p>Using the most scuffed, path-of-least-resistance strategies, I developed a the best keyboard ever. That's right, the best. Until I make the second version, I mean. Following is an overly-detailed explanation of everything I did and why I did it. Don't worry, there's pictures.</p>
  
 <h2 id="Intro">Background</h2>
    <p>I have always been interested in keyboards. When I was six, I meticulously dismantled my mother's non-functioning 	
<a href="http://herculesworkshop.com/images/d/4717/Hercules_Workshop_Smith_Corona_SD_300.jpg">Smith Corona SD 300</a> beyond any possible repair or reassembly. I just wanted to know how it worked!<br> 
  As I grew up, I eventually learned about mechanical keyboards from the internet. Inevitably, I came across the hobby scene for it and bought a few kits to put together.
  The <a href="https://github.com/kata0510/Lily58">Lily58</a> became my first ever split keyboard, and I loved it. I eventually moved on to Keeb.io's 
   <a href="https://keeb.io/collections/iris-split-ergonomic-keyboard">Iris</a> and after using it for a few months I decided I wanted to make my own keyboard, one that was perfect for me. <br>
   Despite my love for ergonomic keyboards, I had a few problems with them. While I have big hands, my fingers are proportionally rather short. The uppermost of the 4 rows felt like a big waste of space to me; and my pinkies could not reach the second row without moving my whole hand for them, let alone the second row in the outermost columns.<br>
      This meant there were<b> twenty-two </b>unusable keys on the Lily, and twenty on the Iris, but only because it was missing two of those unusable keys in the first place. 
      
 While I loved the knobs on the Iris, I missed having four thumb keys like on the Lily. Except that fourth thumb key on the Lily was somewhat uncomfortable to reach. There needed to be a different way to lay them out. Though I saw keyboards like the <a href="https://www.ergodox.io/">Ergodox</a> had multiple rows of thumb keys, I didn't like the idea. It seemed inelegant. The <a href="https://github.com/splitkb/kyria">Kyria</a> seemed to have a good way of handling it that could work if cut down to just four keys, and later it would serve as a starting-off point for my own design.
   <br>What's more, I needed some sort of wrist rest to keep my wrists straight due to the height of the keyboards. I had seen some people solve this with weird squishy memory foam things, and others by switching from Cherry MX <a href="https://www.gboards.ca/">to Kailh Choc and having no case for the pcb.</a><br> I had a different idea, however, that would allow me to offset my hands exactly as much as I needed for key switches, without losing the 4mm travel distance afforded by MX switches.
   
 </p>
 <h2 id="Objectives">Objectives and Considerations</h2>
  
  
  
  <h3>My theories on design.</h3>
    <p>The first tenet of design for this keyboard was that designing with other people in mind is undesirable.
  Too often, designing for others ends up meaning designing something you like less. This is a fallacy, because if you came
  to like that design, then it means it's possible for others to learn to like it too. What's more, there's assuredly people just like you
  who, if you tamed your design, would now be missing out. That's not to say my design ended up particularly niche or inaccessible, it fits quite
  boringly alongside every other split ergonomic keyboard minus a few quirks.</p>
  
  
  
  <br>Thus, I began to form a laundry list of features I wanted, combining pet concepts and accomodations for myself:
  <li>
    <ul>More thumb keys. These are too perfect for shortcuts.</ul>
    <ul></ul>
    <ul></ul>
    <ul></ul>
    <ul></ul>
    <ul></ul>
    <ul></ul>
    <ul></ul>
    <ul></ul>
    <ul></ul>
    <ul></ul>
  </li>
