                <hr>
                <!-- <img src="cardboard assisted design mas.png" class="article-image"> -->
                <h1 id="Start">Introduction</h1>
                <p>The following keyboard operators are some of my close friends, each with an entirely different keyboard. I will ask them these same questions, and any others of note, over the course of a few years starting now. I would be very interested to see how their experiences change over time. Think of this as a twin study, without twins, and with way less study.</p>
                <h2 id="Gary Huffmaster">&ensp;Interview with Gary Huffmaster of Meridian Community College</h2>
                <p>Gary Huffmaster is a media production student at Meridian Community College. He uses a standard-style QWERTY keyboard made by Amazon basics.</p>
                <h3 id="Gary's Keyboard">&emsp;What keyboard do you use on a day-to-day basis?</h3>
                <p>“I use an Amazon Basics keyboard that is currently only purchasable on amazon through a bundle with an Amazon basics mouse, which I do not own or use. It is very servicable and I have had zero issues using it in the many years I have been doing so.”</p>
                <h3 id="Frequency of Use">&emsp;How much do you use your keyboard every day?</h3>
                <p>“I use my computer honestly too much. I don't know exactly how much I use it every day, but I send a lot of messages to my friends over discord and type a lot of things into browsers. And I play games on it. Basically, I use it a lot more than the average person does.”</p>
                <h3 id="On Alternative Layouts">&emsp;Do you see yourself ever learning an optimized key layout like Colemak-DH?</h3>
                <p>“I don't see myself ever learning an alternate key layout. QWERTY is so widespread that it has become the unbreakable standard in keyboards. Any new PC or normal keyboard or even smart phone you buy will have QWERTY as the default. If by some crazy chance, an alternative layout breaks through, that is when I will consider learning it. But as for now, there I have no reason to impede my typing (an every day activity for me) by trying to learn a layout that would only be on my personal computer.”</p>
                <h3 id="Wrist Pain">&emsp;Do you experience tightness in your wrist from long periods of work?</h3>
                <p>“I personally don't notice any tightness. That could be because I'm just used to it, but it could also be the sheer amount of stimming I do with my hands giving them an adequate enough workout to where it relieves all the pain.”</p>
                <h3 id="Factors in Decision">&emsp;How much does the time it would take to learn Colemak factor into that decision?</h3>
                <p>“I'd say it factors in a good amount. The amount of time that my daily typing would be impeded by having to backspace and retype things and looking at the keyboard would just be annoying. I already type in a weird method I invented because I didn't want to learn normally in middleschool, I don't want to have to develop this again.”</p>
                <h2 id="James R. Burns">&ensp;Interview with James R. Burns, alumnus of the University of Ulster</h2>
                <p>James R. Burns is a graduate of the University of Ulster, and current Administration Officer of the Child Maintenance Service (United Kingdom). He uses a split Lily58 assembled from a kit.</p>
                <h3 id="James' Keyboard">&emsp;What keyboard do you use on a day-to-day basis?</h3>
                <p>“At home I use a split Lily58 keyboard with the Colemak DH layout for my personal computer, but I also regularly use a standard QWERTY keyboard at my office job. I'd prefer to use my personal keyboard at work, however external computer equipment isn't permitted for security reasons.”</p>
                <h3 id="On Alternative Layouts part two">&ensp;You use Colemak DH, why do you stick with it?</h2>
                <p>“The efficient spacing feels alot more natural on the hand. It took me a little bit to get used to it, but once I did, typing felt alot more natural than it did on standard QWERTY. Like my hands were doing a better job keeping up with my thoughts.”</p>
                <h3 id="Interoperability">&ensp;Are you able to type on QWERTY and Colemak DH interchangeably?</h3>
                <p>”Quite interchangeably. I thought using QWERTY might be harder after using my Colemak keyboard for so long but after starting an office job, I find I have absolutely no problem switching between the two.”</p>
                <h3 id="Wrist Pain part two">Do you experience tightness in your wrist from long periods of work?</h3>
                <p>“Not especially, but I tend to avoid frequent long periods of work.”</p>
